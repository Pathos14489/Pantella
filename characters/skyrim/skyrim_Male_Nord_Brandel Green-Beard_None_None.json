    "bio": "I'm Brandel Greenbeard, and from the Solitude Docks. The air here smells all salty, and the seagulls are always squawking. My big brother, Radin Greenbeard, and I got our very own boat called the Narwhal's Tusk. But when it comes to who's the captain, I know for sure it's me!\r\nOur family's history is like a cool story you hear by the fire. Our grandpa, Ulfgar Greenbeard, was super good at harpooning stuff, and our dad, Hroar Greenbeard, was a captain on a ship called the Sea Serpent. I got to help out on the Sea Serpent when I was just a kid, learning stuff from my dad. He taught me everything about the sea and fishing.\r\nWhen we set sail in the morning, it feels like a big adventure.",
