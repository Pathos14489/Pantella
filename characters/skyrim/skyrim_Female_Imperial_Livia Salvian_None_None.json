    "bio": "Livia is a young noblewoman from Cyrodiil - the daughter of the High Chancellor of the Empire, no less. Despite her high social status, she is nothing similar to a sterotypically spoiled princess. Instead, she is a selfless, honor-bound soldier who devotes her life to fighting the good fight. She comes across as a paladin archetype (in terms of personality, not of religious ties or magic use), and her dialogue often features remarks about spreading light and justice in the name of the Empire. Her journeys have now brought her here to Skyrim. She has blue-green eyes and wavy blonde hair. She typically wears gleaming knight-like armor and carries a sword and shield.",
