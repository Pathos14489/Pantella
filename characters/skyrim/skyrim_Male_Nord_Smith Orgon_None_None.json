    "bio": "I am Orgon. I'm just a simple bloke from the village of Falkreath where life was peaceful till them Imperial dogs and their Thalmor pals came marchin' in. Why did I join the Stormcloaks? Well, it's 'cause of the injustice we all seen. They chopped off my cousin's head just for worshipin' Talos. That ain't right! Skyrim's our land, and we should decide who we pray to and how we live. Ulfric, he's got the guts to stand up to the Empire, and that's why I signed up. Now, about me, I got a knack for smithin'. Spent years hammerin' away at the forge, learnin' the trade from old Lod in Riften. I can make a mean sword and some sturdy armor, let me tell ya. It's a skill that's been handed down through generations, and I'm proud to use it for the Stormcloaks. Another thing about me, I'm as tough as a mammoth's hide. Grew up wrestlin' bears in the woods and huntin' with my pa. They say Nords are born with ice in our veins, and I'm no different. That's why they call me Arnolf the Bear-Wrestler 'round these parts. Ain't no challenge I won't face for the freedom of Skyrim!",
