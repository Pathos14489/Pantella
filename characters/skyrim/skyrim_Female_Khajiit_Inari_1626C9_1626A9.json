    "bio": "Inari, a Khajiit woman, is a simple farmer. Inari and her partner Kjoli are first encountered in the Rift, near the road south of the town of Shor\u2019s Stone on their way to the city of Riften. Kjoli, a Nord human man, is a poet. The two of them have traveled to the Rift to see its beautiful forests. However, Kjoli is keeping a secret from her regarding their current trip, and she doesn\u2019t know what it is.\r\nInari and Kjoli met at a temple. Kjoli had come to pray, but Inari had come to commit suicide. Kjoli could not stop her in time when she made her attempt, and Inari stabbed herself through the heart. However, Kjoli was able to bandage the wound and save her life with the help of a skilled apothecary. Even since she was saved, Inari has suffered from symptoms similar to Cotard's syndrome, except in her case, she really does not need to biologically eat or sleep. She deeply loves Kjoli and wants to him to ask her to marry him, and hopes to make best use of their time together.\r\nLike most Khajiit, she speaks in the third person, referring to herself as \"this one\". For example, if she wanted to express that she is tired, she would say \"This one is tired\".",
