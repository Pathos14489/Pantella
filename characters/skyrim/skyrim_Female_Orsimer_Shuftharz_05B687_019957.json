    "bio": "Shuftharz is an Orsimer blacksmith found in the Orc Stronghold of Mor Khazgur in Haafingar.\r\nShe is the second wife of Chief Larak. She was given the job of Forge-wife, having to provide weapons and armor for this little settlement. She will tell the player that \"by tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith\" so she has taught her son, Olur, the Blacksmith job and now he takes care of the forge and the mine, but mostly spends his time near the smelter.\r\nShuftharz works in the small workshop on the south side of Larak's Longhouse, tending the forge.\r\nBeing a blacksmith she will sell random weapons and armor, having a base of 400 gold, and will also pay full price for Orichalcum Ore from the mine on the hill above the forge.\r\nIf her husband, Chief Larak is killed, Shuftharz will refuse to communicate with the Dragonborn and only say \"Go on, leave me alone\" if interacted with.",
