    "bio": "Moth gro-Bagol is an Orsimer Skyrim who lives in Markarth. He is found in Understone Keep, upstairs and to the right, he serves as Blacksmith to the Jarl. He is also a potential candidate for marriage.\r\nMoth was raised in an Orc Stronghold along with his sister, Ghorza where they both first learned the ways of the hammer and anvil. Eventually, Moth abandoned his tribe with his sister and enrolled with the Legion, mastering his skills as a smith for over ten years.\r\nDuring of which, Moth served alongside Thongvor Silver-Blood, and refers to him respectfully as a \"good man and a tough soldier.\"\r\nWhen asked about armor recommendations, Moth proposes to provide armor for the Dragonborn if they bring him a Daedra Heart that he needs to cool the Jarl's sword. Upon returning with the heart, Moth rewards them with a piece of either heavy or light armor. He also rewards them with making them Blood-Kin, granting them access to the Orc Strongholds around Skyrim, and when asked, directs them to the stronghold of Dushnikh Yal to the southeast of Markarth.\r\nOnce brought a Daedra Heart, Moth becomes a potential candidate for marriage. If married, he will maintain his store, sharing a profit of 100 gold a day with his spouse, and will continue to sell weapons, armor, and smithing materials.\r\nMoth has also been known to send thugs after the Dragonborn should they ever steal from him.\r\nWhat kind of weapons do you forge? \"Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine. Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.\" I'm thinking of buying some armor. Any recommendations? \"Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it. If you want some heavy armor, I might have a deal we could work out. I need a Daedra's Heart. Jarl wants me to cool his new sword in blood. You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?\"",
