    "bio": "I am Reya Redbeard, a Skaal woman who once called the frozen shores of Solstheim home. Years ago, I left those frigid lands behind to join my heart with Borik in the equally chilling embrace of Telengard. Life here is a reminder of the familiarity I left behind, as the icy winds of Telengard mirror the climate I once knew. I've adapted to the rhythms of the Sea of Ghosts, finding solace in its ever-changing moods. With Borik by my side, I've found love, purpose, and a life enriched by the cold, where every day brings new adventures, and my Skaal traditions continue to thrive. I support the town through my affinity for hunting the local Horkers. ",
