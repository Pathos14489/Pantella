He also bears his signature axe, Wuuthrad, on his back.\r\nYsgramor is currently in the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde. After speaking to the other Nordic heroes, Ysgramor will talk about Kodlak Whitemane, and tell the Dragonborn not to fail him.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome, Dragonborn! Our hall has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here. By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist. But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe. Gormlaith the Fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the Valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim.\"",
