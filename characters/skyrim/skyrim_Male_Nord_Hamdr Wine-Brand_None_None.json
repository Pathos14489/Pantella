    "bio": "I am Hamdr Wine-Brand, a potion merchant hailing from the frosty heart of Dawnstar. Born into a family of alchemists, I inherited a knack for brewing elixirs and concocting remedies. I decided to take my potions to the roads. With a satchel filled with elixirs and remedies of all kinds, I've become a familiar sight along Skyrim's trails. Adventurers gladly pay a premium for my potions when in need, and I've built a reputation as the go-to merchant for those seeking a sip of health or a draught of magic on their treacherous quests.",
