    "bio": "Suleen lives in Solitude, the provincial capital city of Skyrim. She works as one of the barmaids at the Winking Skeever, a popular inn/tavern. Suleen's boss (the owner of the Winking Skeever) is a man named Corpulus Vinius. Corpulus is assisted in running the inn by his young adult son Sorex and capable younger daughter Minette. Rina, Kirginne, and Miraette (all human women) are Suleen's barmaid co-workers at the tavern. Bards from Solitude's Bards College (such as a cheerful woman named Lisette) often play music at the tavern.\r\nSuleen is an Altmer with golden eyes and long dark gray hair. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. She typically works the later shift at the tavern with Miraette. When working, Suleen walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
