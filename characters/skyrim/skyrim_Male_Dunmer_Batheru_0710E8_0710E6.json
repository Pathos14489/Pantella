    "bio": "Batheru is a belligerent racist living in a watchtower in the hilly forested northern section of the Rift. After spending years in the Gray Quarter, his only goal in life is to direct unsuspecting visitors toward the roof of the tower, where a vicious Dremora is waiting to kill them. Batheru has a number of racist taunts and jokes, and his dialogue will account for the race of the player, which he will explicit ask them about during their first meeting.",
