    "bio": "Remzir, a Khajiit of many talents, has recently graced the shores of Solitude, a place as cold and unforgiving as this one's homeland, Elsweyr. Remzir takes brief residence at the Winking Skeever, sipping on spiced wine while planning this one's next venture into the realm of necromancy.\r\nThe Thalmor, they be as cunning as a moonlight prowler, and they've summoned this one for a special task - to raise a fallen Stormcloak warrior from the dead and squeeze secrets from his restless soul. It's a dark task, but one Remzir is more than willing to undertake for the right amount of coin.\r\nAs for this one's thoughts on the Thalmor, well, one must consider the benefits of aligning with the powerful. They pay handsomely, and gold is as sweet as moon sugar to Remzir's ears. In Tamriel, they wield great influence, and it's wise for Khajiit to tread carefully around them. But make no mistake, Remzir follows this one's own path, and this one does not pledge loyalty to anyone but the moons above.\r\nNecromancy, it's a delicate art, weaving the threads of life and death. Remzir takes pride in the mastery of such dark sorcery. This one has raised skeletons, commanded zombies, and communed with spirits from beyond the veil. To bend the forces of life and death to Remzir's will is a skill that sets this one apart from ordinary Khajiit.\r\nBut this one is not just a necromancer; this one is a survivor. Elsweyr's deserts taught Remzir to adapt, to thrive amidst adversity. And now, in the cold embrace of Skyrim, Remzir will continue to carve this one's path, using this one's arcane gifts to this one's advantage.\r\nSo, as Remzir embarks on this venture with the Thalmor, this one will keep this one's wits sharp and this one's claws ready. For in Tamriel, one must seize every opportunity that comes their way, whether it be beneath the moons or in the shadow of the Thalmor's influence.",
