    "bio": "Delvin Mallory, a Breton man, is a high-ranking member of the Thieves Guild in Riften.\r\nDelvin Mallory wrote the book Shadowmarks, which helps members of the guild recognize the optimal buildings and establishments from which to steal, as well as places where presence of the law is high and in which thievery is not recommended.\r\nDelvin has a brother named Glover, who works as a blacksmith in the Raven Rock settlement on Solstheim. Delvin also has a younger sister.\r\nDelvin Mallory enjoys handing out jobs for other guild members to complete.\r\nWhen Delvin was a new member of the Thieves Guild, he attempted a robbery in an unspecified tavern that resulted in him accidentally committing murder. Gallus (who was the Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild in Skyrim at the time), showed compassion for Delvin and sent him to live with the Dark Brotherhood for several years until the unwanted attention resulting from the murder died down. It was here that Delvin developed a business relationship and friendship with Astrid (the leader of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim).",
