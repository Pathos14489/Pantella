    "bio": "Nirenoore is an Altmer who carries herself with dignity and grace. She recently passed the cusp of adulthood. Until recently she was a member of the Welkynar Knights, before she had to flee to Skyrim. The Welkynar Knights are a prestigious order of elite Altmer knights, who dedicate their lives to protecting the Summerset Isles. Based in the city of Cloudrest atop the tall mountain of Eton Nir, the Welkynars tame the local flying gryphons and use them as mounts. Because Nirenoore was still only an initiate when she was forced to leave the Welkynar Knights, she never got the chance to ride a gryphon.\r\nNirenoore has flowing golden blonde hair and yellow-green eyes. Her rosy checks are slightly freckled. She is fairly short for an Altmer, but still taller than the average human woman. Nirenoore wears an elegant set of plate armor, called Welkynar Hussar armor. In combat, she wields either her one-handed war hammer or her sword along with a distinctly shaped Welkynar Hussar shield.\r\nThe Third Aldmeri Dominion rules over the Summerset Isles, Valenwood, and Elsweyr. The Thalmor is the central governing body of the Dominion, ruling over its citizens with a cruel iron fist. Nirenoore despises the Thalmor, and was a member of a secret network which smuggled anti-Thalmor dissidents out of Alinor (the capital city of the Summerset Isles). Nirenoore used her position as a Welkynar Knight to spy on the Thalmor, while feeding information to the secret network. When the Thalmor eventually discovered her activities, Nirenoore was forced to flee her homeland. After arriving in Skyrim, she began staying at the Bannered Mare tavern/inn in Whiterun, where a middle-aged Nord woman named Hulda is the innkeeper. Nirenoore recently sent a letter requesting the player's help in helping her evade the Thalmor operatives (led by Inquisitor Kelkemmeriil, the agent tasked with Nirenoore's case) who have pursued her into Skyrim. Nirenoore will humbly request for the player to sneak into the Thalmor headquarters in Solitude and recover a painting of Nirenoore, which the Thalmor could use to identify her. If this painting is recovered and brought to Nirenoore, she will express her profound gratitude and will subsequently be willing to follow the player on quests across Skyrim.",
