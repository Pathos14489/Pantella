    "bio": "Ulundil is an Altmer and owner of Windhelm Stables just outside Windhelm, where he can be found outside during opening hours. He is married to Arivanya.\r\nUnlike many Altmer met in Skyrim, he is friendly and polite, though he gets a bit stiff when \"only\" offered 1,000  for a horse.\r\nUlundil will sometimes mention that he is not afraid of dragons, and whatever happens will happen, but he will not live in fear.\r\nIf the Dragonborn is a member of the Thieves Guild, a contract may be set out to retrieve Ulundil's garnet.",
