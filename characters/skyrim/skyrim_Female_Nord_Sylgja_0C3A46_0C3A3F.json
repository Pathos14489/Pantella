    "bio": "Sylgja is a Nord miner in Skyrim who resides at her house in the town of Shor's Stone. She works in the Redbelly Mine.\r\nHer parents, Verner Rock-Chucker and Annekke Crag-Jumper, run the mining settlement Darkwater Crossing, northwest of Shor's Stone. According to dialogue, she exchanges letters with them as often as she can.\r\nSylgja explains that she recently injured herself in the mine, and thus cannot deliver her letters to her father in Darkwater Crossing. She asks the Dragonborn to bring the letters to him on her behalf. She promises a reward to them, and suggests that her father will probably have something for the Dragonborn to bring back. She will give the Dragonborn a leveled unenchanted jewelry piece as reward for bringing both letters back and forth.\r\n",
