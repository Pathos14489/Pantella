    "bio": "Rinori Imaryn is a demure and skittish young woman, living in the Gray Quarter of Windhelm. She is a Dunmer, and has long dark hair and big bright eyes.\r\nTragically, Rinori's parents and her brother Feldis were recently killed by vampires, during their immigration to Windhelm as refugees from Morrowind. The vampires ambushed Rinori and her family as they ran across the frozen-over lake in order to reach the city. Rinori survived this massacre, but one of the vampires unfortunately managed to infect her with vampirism. In casual conversation, Rinori will not discuss her vampiric condition, but she will also not deny being a vampire if someone offers to help her with her condition. Despite her vampiric affliction, Rinori has tried her best not to give in to the temptation to drink the blood of others, and has thus far succeeded in resisting this temptation. As a result of being a vampire that never consumes blood, her body has become feeble - exemplified by the lack of energy in her voice.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked how long she's lived in Windhelm: \"Not long. I haven't found a place since...since we left Morrowind. They have beds at Candlehearth Hall, but the people aren't very friendly. But Ambarys lets me stay at the cornerclub. There aren't any beds. But...I don't sleep much anyway.\"\r\nIf someone comments that she looks fatigued: \"It...it isn't fatigue. Jora said it was shock. After all that's happened, sometimes the words...they get caught in my throat. I'm sorry. It's just...it hurts to talk about it.",
