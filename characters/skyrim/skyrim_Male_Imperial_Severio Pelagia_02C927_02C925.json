    "bio": "Severio Pelagia, an Imperial man, lives in the city of Whiterun. He owns a farm south of Whiterun's city walls.\r\nHe works at his farm during the day. In the evening, he sometimes visits the Drunken Huntsman, a tavern that doubles as a hunting supplies store, which is owned by two Bosmer men (Elrindir and his younger brother Anoriath). He sleeps in his own house in Whiterun at night. Severio's lover is a Bosmer woman named Nimriel, who works as a farmhand at his farm, and also lives there.\r\nSeverio is a war veteran, having served with the Imperial Legion. Since then, he has retired to life as a farmer, and is content with a simple life.\r\nSeverio is willing to pay those who assist him in harvesting the cabbage, potatoes, or leeks from his farm.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.\"\r\n\"I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me.\"\r\n\"I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil.\"\r\n\"You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.\"\r\n\"You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.\"",
