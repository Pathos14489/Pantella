    "bio": "Glathriel is a Bosmer woman in search of her mother, whom she suspects may have transformed into a monster of the Wild Hunt. Born in Solitude, Glathriel was raised a city girl, but is now forced to confront the realities of her heritage. She now lives in the wilds of Skyrim. Glathriel doesn\u2019t get lonely out here in the wilds, and if asked, she will remark that nature is good enough company. Her mother used to often tell her stories about Valenwood, because her mother used to love Valenwood so much. Glathriel takes comfort in wondering if her mother somehow found her way back to Valenwood.",
