    "bio": "Wylandriah is a Bosmer mage in Skyrim who serves as the court wizard to the Jarl Laila Law-Giver of Riften.\r\nShe is chronically forgetful and talks to herself, often losing her train of thought. Wylandriah's main focus in life is the pursuit of her research, and she cares for little else. While talking with her, she will ask the Dragonborn to assist her in retrieving three items she has misplaced.\r\nAs the court wizard, Wylandriah also sells items relating to the arcane arts, and is known to have, at least on one occasion, caused much consternation to the College of Winterhold.\r\nAfter giving her all the items, she will thank the Dragonborn for the \"uncanny foresight\" as, by then, she has completely forgotten about them. She will still offer a reward, however.",
