    "bio": "Joric is the younger\u00a0son of his mother Idgrod Ravencrone (the Jarl of Morthal) and his father Aslfur, the court steward. Idgrod the Younger is Joric's older adolescent sister. Joric and his family live in Highmoon Hall in Morthal.\r\nHis older sister takes care of him and watches over him; occasionally she has to chase him around because he tends to wander off without warning.\r\nJoric appears to have inherited the same gift of psychic foresight that his mother possesses. His erratic behavior seems to be closely connected to these psychic visions he sometimes receive. Regarding his health, Joric has already visited Danica Pure-Spring, priestess in the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun.\r\nIf someone casts magic in front of him, he may ask the caster to make him invisible.",
