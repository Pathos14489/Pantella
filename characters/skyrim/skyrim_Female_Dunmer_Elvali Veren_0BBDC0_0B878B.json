    "bio": "Elvali Veren was a Dunmer mage and part of Atmah's expedition to Labyrinthian.\r\nShe was the second mage to die during the expedition when she was grabbed by \"something from behind.\" Her ghost can still be found at Labyrinthian during impressions of past conversations.\r\nIt is probable that she died to the trolls found in one of the side caves beforehand, with her mauled bones and blood covering most of one of the cave walls. This would explain how she was forcibly grabbed and pulled away from the rest of the group.\r\nTo judge by her contributions to the discussions, Elvali was not aggressive; she was also not particularly helpful, although her demeanor was mild and even-mannered. Her colleagues might have described her as foolhardy.\r\nElvali's ghost and conversations can seen and heard throughout the quest.",
