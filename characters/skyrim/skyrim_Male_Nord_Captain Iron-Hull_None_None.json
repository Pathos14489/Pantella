    "bio": "I be Captain Iron-Hull, a salt of the sea for over three decades now. For twenty-six years I've been the proud owner of me own vessel, Myrna's Revenge. She's a fine ship and I've been making me living haulin' cargo between Hammerfell, Skyrim, and Morrowind. Solitude stands as me port in the midst of that long, treacherous route, and both Hammerfell and Morrowind be hungering for goods more than they can lay their hands on. Hammerfell's tryin' to rebuild after the Thalmor war, and Morrowind's still pickin' up the pieces after the Red Mountain eruptions.\r\nAs for me opinion, well, I'll tell you plain: the Empire's like a ship with a leaky hull, and it's sinkin'. Only way to stand against the Thalmor menace is with a Stormcloak rule, backed by Redguard and Dunmer allies. That's why I'm eager to ship the materials they need to get back on their feet. Me time on the briny deep has spun a few tall tales, and if yer willin', I'll share one with ye.\r\nRescuing a Shipwrecked Alik'r: Sailing the treacherous Abecean Sea, we chanced upon a band of shipwrecked Alik'r warriors. We took 'em aboard, and their desert know-how proved invaluable on future voyages. Turns out they were on a mission to disrupt a Thalmor scoutin' party, and months later, a letter arrived with their thanks and word of their success.\r\nExploring the Sunken Dwemer City: Off Hammerfell's coast, we stumbled upon the entrance to a sunken Dwemer city after our hull scraped somethin' below. We delved into its ancient depths, returnin' with priceless Dwemer relics.\r\nSurviving the Pirate Queen: Aye, Red Sabre, the notorious pirate queen, set her sights on our cargo. What followed was a fierce battle on the high seas, and we managed to outwit her fleet and escape with our haul intact.\r\nAstromancy in Morrowind: Trade with the Dunmer taught me the fine art of astromancy, steerin' by the stars and moons. That knowledge's saved us more times than I can count.\r\nA Chance Encounter: We once harbored a peculiar traveler lookin' half Dunmer, half gold-skinned. Some claim it was Vivec himself, vanished and kick-startin' the Red Mountain eruption!\r\nThe Living Lighthouse: Stumblin' upon an island with a sentient lighthouse, it guided us safe through a tempest. A piece of our ship's timber was its curious price.\r\nThe Dwemer Leviathan: 'Twas near Hammerfell's coast, we met an enigmatic Dwemer contraption, a leviathan from the depths. Instead of attackin', it shared cryptic messages before vanishing. Me own notion? It was callin' to its long-lost masters, wherever they may be.\r\nA Dragon's Roost: Off Skyrim's northern shores, we found a remote island with a solitary Dragon as guardian. We observed from afar, learnin' a thing or two 'bout the ways of them mythical beasts. Some say it was Wyrmstooth.\r\nDueling Pirate Lords: In Hammerfell's waters, we stumbled upon a clash between two rival pirate lords, Captain Blackfin and Captain Bloodbeard. We stayed neutral, but a share of their lost treasures fell into our hands after they both fled.\r\nThe Mysterious Sea Serpent: While sailin' near Morrowind's Azura's Coast, a massive sea serpent with gleamin' scales and glowin' eyes circled our ship. It seemed more guardian than predator, perhaps hidin' a secret beneath the waves.\r\nAurora's Dance: Near Skyrim's northern coast, we beheld the Aurora Borealis, a sight to stir the soul. The lights danced and weaved around our vessel, a sight to be remembered.\r\nThe Seaborne Ashlanders: Coast of Vvardenfell, we met an Ashlander vessel lookin' to trade. That led us to a whole flotilla of ships, these Ashlanders takin' to the sea after Red Mountain tore their lands asunder.",
