    "bio": "Horik Halfhand is a Nord warrior in Skyrim who lives in Dawnstar. He serves as a housecarl and bodyguard to Brina Merilis, and can be found inside The White Hall once certain quest requirements are fulfilled on the Imperial Quest Line.\r\nHorik has served with Brina nearly his whole life. With no command ambitions of his own, he is content to serve as her bodyguard. Horik has nothing but respect and admiration for his commander, and there are few things that would shake his loyalty of her.\r\nHorik \"Are you alright? You seem tired.\" Horik \"No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have.\" Horik \"Of course. I would have it no other way.\"\r\nBrina \"You never talk about yourself much, do you, Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side and I think I barely know you.\" Horik \"What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since.\" Brina \"What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?\" Horik \"No. Can't say that there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since.\" Horik \"You weren't. There's just not much to it.\"",
