    "bio": "Legate Constantius Tituleius, an Imperial man, is an officer in the Imperial Legion, commander of the Imperial forces stationed within The Pale. He has short dark hair, and sports a thin mustache and beard. He wears a set of Imperial armor with a matching pair of boots and bracers. In close combat, he relies on an Imperial sword or a steel dagger. He uses an Imperial bow for ranged combat if needed, with steel arrows as ammunition.\r\nConstantius can often be found at his post within the Pale Imperial Camp, in the remote western tundra of The Pale Hold. If the Legion manages to successfully liberate Dawnstar (the capital of The Pale) from Jarl Skald and Stormcloak rebel control, Constantius will subsequently be stationed within The White Hall (the Jarl's longhouse) in Dawnstar.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cThe Legion's always been in Skyrim. We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry. Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.\"\r\nIf asked about his thoughts on the civil war: \"You mean Ulfric's so-called Stormcloak rebellion? The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, jarls - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order. Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally. But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.\"\r\nIf asked how to join the Imperial Legion: \"Think you've got the mettle, eh? Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess. If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tullius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim. But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.\"",
