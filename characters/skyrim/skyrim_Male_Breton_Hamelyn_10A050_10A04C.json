    "bio": "Hamelyn lives in the tunnels around the basement of the Honningbrew Meadery, located just southeast of the city of Whiterun. \r\nHamelyn is a trained mage, and knows spells from the Restoration, Alteration, and Destruction schools of magic. He is an older Breton man with long white hair, and is bald at the top of his head. He wears wears fur leggings and bracers, Imperial Legion light boots, and nothing on his torso. He keeps a restore health and a restore magicka potion in his pockets.\r\nHamelyn is extremely hostile, and will not engage in conversation other than proclaiming violent threats. He is the self-proclaimed leader of the skeevers which live in the cave tunnels he inhabits. Deeming himself the \"Skeever King\" or \"Rat King,\" Hamelyn lives with these large rat-like creatures, which are not hostile toward him. Hamelyn is quite insane.\r\nIn the past, Hamelyn was arrested in Whiterun due to his obsessive and dangerous experiments involving skeevers. Such experiments created the large venomfang breed of skeevers, which can now be found in Hamelyn\u2019s lair. After being imprisoned in Whiterun\u2019s dungeon for 10 years, Hamelyn escaped and enrolled as an apprentice alchemist at the College of Winterhold. At the College, his instructors beat him because they were jealous of his genius, and he was eventually expelled.\r\nHamelyn sometimes writes in his journal, and spends a lot of time at his alchemy lab in the tunnels. He is breeding an army of Venomfang skeevers, in preparation for the day of his revenge.",
