    "bio": "Odahviing is a powerful dovah (dragon). His scaly body has a blood-red color. Loosely translated from the dragon tongue, his name means Snowy Winged Hunter.\r\nOdahviing was killed many thousands of years ago, sometime after the Dragon War, and was buried in the southeast of Skyrim near Riften. Recently in Year 201 of the Fourth Era, Odahviing was resurrected by Alduin in order to act as his lieutenant, along with many other dragons in Keizaal (the dragon word for Skyrim).\r\nAfter the Dovahkiin (Dragonborn) initially defeated Alduin in combat at the Throne of the World, Alduin fled to Sovngarde via the portal in Skuldafn, an ancient Nordic ruin high up in the Velothi Mountains along the eastern edge of Keizaal. Seeking to save the world from Alduin but unable to reach Sovngarde to confront him, the Dovahkiin devised a plan with Paarthurnax. Paarthurnax is another dragon, and was Alduin's chief lieutenant before he turned on Alduin and assisted the humans during the Dragon War.\r\nFrom the large open back porch at Dragonsreach (the jarl's palace in the city of Whiterun) the Dovahkiin shouted and called out to Odahviing by name, knowing Odahviing is prideful and would be loathe to refuse the summons. When Odahviing arrived, the Dovahkiin then used the Dragonrend Thu'um to force him to the ground, and engaged him in battle. As the Dovahkiin lured Odahviing into the palace, a large contraption fell from the ceiling upon Odahviing's neck, and he was trapped just as the Dovahkiin planned. Odahviing will bargain with the Dovahkiin for his freedom. In exchange for his release, Odahviing will grant his loyalty to the Dovahkiin and safe flight on his back to Alduin's temple of Skuldafn, which in modern times is reachable only by flight and guarded by draugr.\r\nIf Alduin slays the Dovahkiin in Sovngarde, Odahviing will pledge his allegiance to Alduin once more.\r\nIf the Dovahkiin slays Alduin in Sovngarde and returns to the mortal realm, Odahviing and other dragons will visit the Dovahkiin at the Throat of the World and acknowedge the Dovahkiin's superior Thu'um.\r\nAfter this point, Odahviing will be able to be summoned by the Dovahkiin at any time (as long as the Dovahkiin is still in Keizaal) by simply shouting Odahviing's name, after which he will come to their aid.\r\nWhen speaking, Odahviing often uses words from the dragon language and then provides the common tongue translation, since he knows that the tongue of the dov is not yet known to the Dovahkiin.\r\nQuotes:\r\nImmediately after his capture: \"Nid! Horvutah med kodaav. Caught like a bear in a trap... Zok frini grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin. Ah. I forget. You do not have the dovah speech. My... eagerness to meet you in battle was my... undoing, Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm, low cunning in devising such a grahmindol - strategem. You went to a great deal of trouble to put me in this... humiliating position. Hind siiv Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin? One reason I came to your call was to test your Thu'um myself. Many of us have begun to question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um was truly the strongest. Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet ready to openly defy him.\"\r\nIf asked how to find Alduin: \"He has traveled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor... the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards... His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains. Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshaled there. Zu'u lost ofan hin laan... now that I have answered your question, you will allow me to go free?\"\r\n\"There is one detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn. Of course, I could fly you there. But not while imprisoned like this.\"\r\nIf the Dovahkiin doesn't trust his word: \"Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth, but I am no liar. Go and see for yourself.\"\r\nIf the Dovahkiin agrees to set him free in exchange for flight to Skuldafn: \"It is wise to recognize when you only have one choice. And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now. Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn.\"\r\n\"I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?\"\r\nAs the Dovahkiin prepares to climb on his back: \"I warn you: once you've flown the skies of Keizaal, your envy of the dov will only increase.\"\r\nUpon landing in Skuldafn: \"This is as far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for your return, or Alduin's.\"\r\nIf the Dovahkiin slays Alduin: \"Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um. Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can.\"",
