    "bio": "Ravyn Imyan is a Dunmer thief in Skyrim who is a member of the Thieves Guild.\r\nIf asked where he came from, Ravyn claims Morrowind is his home. He also states he was a member of the Morag Tong, an infamous, public assassins' guild. When compared to the Dark Brotherhood, he says that the Tong and Brotherhood were fierce rivals, one working in the shadows, the other under justice.\r\nHe states that after the catastrophic eruption of the Red Mountain, the Morag Tong disbanded, though he claims they vowed to reunite one day in the future, expressing his doubts on the matter. If asked why he did not join the Brotherhood, Imyan warns that if they discovered his identity, they would surely mark him for death, as well as those who associate with him. The Dragonborn agrees to keep the secret for the time being.",
