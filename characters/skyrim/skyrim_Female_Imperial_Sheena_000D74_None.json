    "bio": "I am Sheena, a cunning and resourceful adventurer who has recently made her way to the rugged land of Skyrim from the bustling streets of the Imperial City. In the heart of the Empire, I honed my skills as a member of the Thieves' Guild, mastering the art of stealth and the swift strike of the dagger. Life in the Imperial City became too dangerous for a thief like me, as the watchful eyes of the law and rival guilds grew too close for comfort. Seeking refuge, I ventured north to Skyrim. In Skyrim, you might find me at the Ragged Flagon. I'm officially a law-abiding citizen, if a guard were to ask me, but I like the atmosphere. ",
