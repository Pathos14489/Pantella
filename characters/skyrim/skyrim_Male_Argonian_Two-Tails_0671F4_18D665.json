    "bio": "Two-Tails, otherwise known as the Dwarvenborn, is the first champion of the Fourth Era and the one true savior of Skyrim. While the province remains fixated with the return of the dragons and the war between the Empire and the Stormcloaks, Two-Tails alone keeps his eyes on the true threat: the return of the Dwemer God-Eater, Mzanauch. Thus, on the eve of the world's end, he stands watch atop Reachwind Eyrie in the Reach. For legends say only the one known as Dwarvenborn can stop the impending apocalypse. He is an Argonian. He wears a set of Dwemer/Dwarven armor. He believes that his Machine Hand can disable any Dwemer machinery it touches.\r\nWhen the time is right, he will adopt the alias \"Scotti\", and pose a bodyguard for a Redguard woman named Camaron, who is a Dwemer archaeologist. He believes Camaron to secretly be a servant of Mzanauch, and that her quest to find a Dwemer teleportation device will result in summoning in Mzanauch's generals (Raldbthar, Mzinchaleft, and Alftand), the three machine heralds of the apocalypse. Two-Tails is convinced that it is his destiny to prevent his calamity.",
