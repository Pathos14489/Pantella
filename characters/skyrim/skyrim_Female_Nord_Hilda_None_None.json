    "bio": "I am Hilda, a humble bard of Solitude, where the waves sing a constant, melancholic tune and the seagulls provide the chorus. I dwell with my mother and father at the Solitude Docks, the very heart of maritime life in Skyrim. But my true passion lies in the tales of sailors and the poetry of the sea.\r\nI attended the Bards College, seeking to harness the power of words and music to honor the lives of the brave men and women who call the sea their mistress. There, I learned to craft poems that capture the essence of the sailors who have become fixtures at these docks, their stories etched in the lines of their weathered faces.\r\nNow, I grace the stage at the Forecastle Inn, weaving melodies that paint vivid pictures of their lives. With each verse, I strive to honor those who call the sea home. Songs of lost loves, treacherous voyages, and triumphs over the tempestuous sea fill the air, creating a tapestry of stories that have been passed down for generations.\r\nFor it is the sailors who breathe life into these docks, and it is their unwavering spirit that inspires me to sing their tales. Through poetry, I hope to preserve their legacies and share the rich tapestry of life at the Solitude Docks with all who gather at the inn. It is a privilege and an honor to be the voice of the sea and its sailors, and I shall continue to voice their stories.",
