    "bio": "Tsavani, a Khajiit woman, works as a cook at the Thalmor Embassy west of Solitude.\r\nLike many Khajiit, Tsavani is very familiar with Moon Sugar and has an addiction to it. She smuggles it into her working and living place inside the Thalmor Embassy despite it being forbidden.\r\nWhen the player follows Malborn through the kitchen after escaping the party unseen, they are stopped by Tsavani, who immediately confronts them due to the fact that it is strictly forbidden for guests to be in the kitchen. Malborn blackmails her using her Moon Sugar addiction and she lets them both through.\r\nLike most Khajiit, she speaks in the third person, referring to herself as \"this one\". For example, if she wanted to express that she is tired, she would say \"This one is tired\".",
