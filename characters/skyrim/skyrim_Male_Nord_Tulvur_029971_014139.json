    "bio": "Tulvur is a Nord farmer in Skyrim who lives and works at Hollyfrost Farm. He will buy wheat from the Dragonborn.\r\nTulvur: \"Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost.\" Tulvur: \"Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start.\" Torsten: \"I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.\" Tulvur: \"I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow.\"\r\nTorsten: \"It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place.\" Tulvur: \"Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city.\" Torsten: \"I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you.\" Tulvur: \"I'll do my best, sir.\"\r\nTulvur: \"I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.\" Hillevi: \"Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money.\" Tulvur: \"Thank you, miss, I appreciate that.\" Tullvur: \"Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!\"\r\n",
