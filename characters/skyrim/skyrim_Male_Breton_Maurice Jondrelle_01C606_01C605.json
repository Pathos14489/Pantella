    "bio": "Maurice Jondrelle is a devout worshiper of the goddess Kynareth. He is on an ongoing pilgrimage to visit holy sites all across Skyrim. Recently, upon entering the Wind District of the city of Whiterun to visit the Gildergreen (a famous tree sacred to Kynareth), Maurice became somewhat distraught after seeing that the tree is damaged and dying. After entering the nearby Temple of Kynareth and speaking to the headpriestess Danica Pure-Spring, Maurice learned that the Gildergreen was recently struck by lightning.\r\nSoon after, Maurice overhears a part of a conversation between the player and Danica, with Danica wishing the player luck on their journey to the Eldergleam Sanctuary. After overhearing this, Maurice asks the player if he can accompany them to the Eldergleam Sanctuary. Located in the Eastmarch hold of Skyrim, the Eldergleam Sanctuary is an ancient grove hidden by rocky hills, and is the home of the Eldergleam. This tree is one of the oldest living things in Tamriel, and is every more sacred to Kynareth than is the Gildergreen; the Gildergreen reportedly grew from a seed of the Eldergleam, thousands of years ago.\r\nMaurice has long brong hair and a thin mustache. He is currently wearing a belted tunic, and carries no armor or weapons. If he is offered a weapon of his choice, he prefers a greatsword. As a Breton, he naturally knows some magic.\r\nOnce within the Eldergleam Sanctuary (assuming the player allows Maurice to accompany them there), Mauice will express amazement at the natural beauty of the sanctuar. However, if Maurice witnesses the player use Nettlebane (a magical dagger able to cut the Eldergleam, which is otherwise impervious to attack) against the Eldergleam Tree's above-ground roots (which block the way to the tree's trunk), Maurice will plead with them to cease their barbarism, and offer an alternative method addressing the Gildergreen issue. Rather than violently extracting sap from the Eldergleam, Maurice will pray to the Eldergleam and hopefully receive an Eldergleam Sapling from it. Admittedly, without sap forcefully extracted from the Eldergleam, the existing Gildergleam will die, but a new Eldergleam Sapling can be planted in its place and will eventually grow into a new Gildergleam. Rebirth and renewal are more pleasing to Kynareth, as opposed to the artificial prolonging of life.\r\nIf the player brutishly continues to  try to extract sap from the Eldergleam despite Maurice's protestations, Maurice and the other nearby pilgrims may become violently hostile towards the player in defense of the Eldergleam, exclaiming things such as \"For Kynareth!\" or \"Scourge of nature!\" as they attack.\r\nHere are some examples of Maurice's dialogue:\r\nWhen first speaking to Danica in the Temple of Kynareth: \"What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches. Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful.\"\r\nWhen speaking to the player: \"Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?\"\r\n\"I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard. I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.\"\r\n\"I thank you for your kindness.\"\r\n\"What's happened to the Gildergreen is a travesty.\"\r\n\"Is it much further to the sanctuary?\"\r\n\"Shall we proceed, friend?\"\r\nIf the player declines to allow Maurice to accompany them: \"I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here at the temple if you change your mind.\"\r\nIf within the Eldergleam Sanctuary: \"I can't believe I've finally made it here.\"\r\n\"It's like it was in my dreams.\"\r\n\"I can almost hear its heart.\"\r\n\"Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.\"\r\nIf the player starts hacking at the Eldergleam's roots with Nettlebane: \"I had no idea you were a man/woman of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?\"\r\nIf the player states that they need to extract sap from the Eldergleam in order to restore the Gildergreen: \"You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun? That's abominable. Barbaric. I'll have no part of this. Why didn't you tell me what you intended?\"\r\nIf the player doesn't heed Maurice's protestations: \"Nature has a way of finding vengeance. You walk a bleak path, friend. One that will lead to suffering.\"\r\nIf Maurice is asked if he has an alternative solution regarding the Gildergreen: \"Well... yes. There is something. It won't repair the tree back at the temple, but we could bring them a new one. \"Follow me. I think I can convince the tree to help us.\"\r\nAfter Maurice prays to the Eldergleam: \"The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling. You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance.\"\r\n\"I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.\"\r\n\"It was my pleasure to help, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces.\"\r\n\"Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.\"",
