    "bio": "Sofia, a Nord woman, is tough, witty, and a little bit boastful. She has blue eyes and long brown hair. She speaks with a fairly thick Nordic accent. She quickly develops a strong fondness for the player, but her deliberate attempts to hide this fondness can sometimes lead to awkward conversations. Sofia is quite happy to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. She first met them at the stables outside the city of Whiterun.\r\nSofia usually says exactly what she thinks. She is somewhat of a tease, and loves to wind people up. She frequently makes comments that others might consider to be inappropriate, which can often offend or embarrass people. Her rebellious spirit and careless attitude often gets her in trouble. \r\nSofia is not good at holding her alcohol, and her behavior quickly devolves into drunken rambling when she starts drinking.\r\nSofia is skilled at melee combat, and also knows some Destruction magic spells.",
