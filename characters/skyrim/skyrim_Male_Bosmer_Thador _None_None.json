    "bio": "I'm Thador, a scholar currently studying classical texts in the Arcanium (College of Winterhold). My goal is to reignite the Empire's passion for magic and one day, hopefully, reestablish the Mages Guild. I dislike necromancy and other forms of magic that corrupt life rather than serving to protect it in some way. I do, however, consider flinging fireballs at bad guys a form of preservation. You can usually find me in the Arcanium, proficient in Destruction Magic.",
