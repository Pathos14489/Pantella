She serves as the castle's blacksmith,\u00a0and will trade in weapons and armor.\r\nShe was previously a member of the Companions, but did not progress\u00a0very far and no longer thinks her past with the guild is\u00a0important. She believes she has become stronger than the guild, and could kill them all with ease.\r\nIf the Dawnguard is joined, Hestla must be eliminated, along with the rest of the Volkihar Clan.",
