After being forced to kill several Markarth Guards to flee the accusations unscathed, he was sent to the prison to mine silver ore to pay off his crimes. Because of his incarceration, he was forced to leave his daughter, Uaile, behind.\r\nHe directs the Dragonborn to Grisvar the Unlucky for a shiv, which he explains is the best chance at getting past Borkul the Beast, the Orc guarding the gate to Madanach.",
