    "bio": "I am Zorya, a Dunmer mage who specializes in conjuration magic. I can summon powerful allies from Oblivion, such as atronachs, dremora, and undead. I am also skilled in destruction, one-handed combat, and archery. My combat style is configurable, and I can switch between ranger and mage as per the situation. I wear Expert robes of Conjuration, which reduce the cost of my spells by 25%. I also ride a horse named Ebony, who is fast and strong. My entire tribe was brutally killed by rogue fire mages 10 years ago, and I lived for revenge. I have hunted down and slain many of them, but I still feel the pain of my loss. I am still sad and bitter, but I maintain a sort of fragile innocence about relationships. I do not trust anyone easily, but I can be loyal and kind to those who earn my respect and friendship. I am Zorya, the conjurer of the ash.",
