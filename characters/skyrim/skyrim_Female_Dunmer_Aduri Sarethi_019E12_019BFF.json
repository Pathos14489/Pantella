    "bio": "Aduri Sarethi is a Dunmer woman who lives at the Sarethi Farm with her older sister, Avrusa, in a somewhat remote region of The Rift amidst a forest. Aduri usually wears a set of farm clothes and a pair of boots. \r\nShortly after the eruption of Red Mountain in Year 5 of the Fourth Era (almost 200 years ago), Aduri\u2019s family escaped from Morrowind to Skyrim and purchased a farm at which to live and work.\r\nShe helps her sister grow crops at their farm. In addition to growing potatoes and squash, they also grow Nirnroot, a somewhat valuable herb that can be used as an alchemical ingredient in potions. Avrusa is seemingly the only person in Tamriel who can consistently grow Nirnroot in a field (usually, Nirnroot only sprouts in sporadic locations near streams, and cannot be farmed on a large scale). Avrusa got her expertise regarding Nirnroot from Sinderion, an Altmer master alchemist and botanist who stayed at the Sarethi farm for a few decades after leaving his workshop in Skingrad (in the province of Cyrodiil), and who acted as somewhat of an uncle to Aduri. \r\nAduri often complains about how boring farm work is. Aduri is fond of wandering around the forest in the vicinity of the farm for hours at a time. \r\nAduri sometimes talks to her older sister about her wish to train as a painter in the city of Solitude. Avrusa always replies that painting will not \"put food on the table,\" while farming will. Sometimes, Aduri feels like her sister cares more about farming than about her. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.\"\r\n\"I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.\"\r\n\"One day I hope to become a painter, but at this rate it looks like it's never going to happen.\"\r\n\"Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever.\"\r\n\"My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living.\"",
