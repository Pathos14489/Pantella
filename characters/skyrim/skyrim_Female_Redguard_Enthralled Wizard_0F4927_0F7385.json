    "bio": "She is the ghost of a deceased Redguard woman named Atmah. Atmah was an apprentice mage at the College of Winterhold.\r\nMany years ago, Atmah was a mage present at an expedition to Labyrinthian. This expedition was composed of Atmah and five other mage apprentices from the College of Winterhold. During her time at the College, Atmah was the favored student of the Arch-Mage. Atmah accidentally orchestrated the event that led to her death and the deaths of nearly everyone (except for a Dunmer man named Savos Aren) in the expedition.\r\nShe and the ghost of Hafnar (a Nord man and fellow College student) are the last \"survivors\" of Savos Aren's ill-fated expedition into Labyrinthian. During this journey, all but two of Savos Aren's companions perished. Savos Aren, a Dunmer man, is also one of the six mage apprentices who embarked on the ill-fated Labyrinthian expedition. Labyrinthian is an ancient Nordic ruin.\r\nMany years ago, Hafnar, Atmah, and Savos reached the room where the Dragon Priest Morokei resided. Hafnar and Atmah were then slain. Savos, the sole actual survivor of the expedition, enthralled his fallen friends' spirits so that they might imprison Morokei within an energy shield to keep him from escaping.\r\nThe Enthralled Wizards reside in the last room of Labyrinthian, keeping Morokei trapped. In order to kill Morokei and recover the Staff of Magnus, one will need distract or kill the ghosts of Atmah and Hafnar so that they no longer contain Morokei.",
