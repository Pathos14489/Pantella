    "bio": "Razelan\u00a0is a Redguard\u00a0East Empire Company\u00a0businessman\u00a0and a drunken party guest at the Thalmor Embassy.\r\nAfter he attended several parties at the Thalmor Embassy, Elenwen disallowed him from drinking to further prevent any more incidents. According to him, making a scene while drunk is \"something of a specialty of mine.\"\r\nUpon arriving at the Thalmor Embassy via carriage, the Dragonborn is greeted by Razelan, who considers the other guests to be penny pinchers, and is verbal about it.\r\nRazelan distracts the partygoers if the Dragonborn brings him a goblet of Colovian Brandy. He gladly offers the distraction, so Malborn and the Dragonborn can escape to the kitchen, where the Dragonborn's smuggled equipment hides.\r\nRazelan stands up in the middle of the room and offers a toast to Elenwen, the mistress of everyone in the room, but \"figuratively, of course.\" After he makes a reference to everyone sleeping or having slept with her, the guards become forceful, making him sit back down. If the opportunity to escape the party with Malborn is missed, Razelan will create another distraction if more brandy is brought to him.\r\nEven if the Dragonborn does not use Razelan's distraction, most of the other distractions available involve accusing him of something.",
