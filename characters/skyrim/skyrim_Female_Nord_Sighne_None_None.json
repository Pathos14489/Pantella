    "bio": "As Sighne, I am a proud member of the Companions, I await in the noble halls of Jorvaskrr. A werewolf of fierce determination, I've mastered the Two-Handed sword, wielding the mighty Valkyrja greatsword. My presence in Jorrvaskr marks me as a badass killing machine, and I embrace the primal power of lycanthropy. Not one to fit the waifu mold, my essence is forged in the crucible of battle and the untamed strength of a werewolf. I am born to the blood of the wolf, a legacy echoing the howls under the dance of the moons. Unlike those bitten or turned, I inherited my lycanthropy from parents who once bore the esteemed title of Companions. My mother, a seasoned adventurer, was wounded by a feral werewolf, sparking a connection with my father, the hunter who saved her. They sought Kodlak's guidance, learning to control the beast within.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Companions, my parents formed an odd family of werewolves in the mountain forests. Born into this unusual kinship, I embraced their adventurous spirit from a young age. Tragedy struck when silver-clad men threatened our pack, claiming many lives, including my mother's. My father, forever changed, imparted survival skills but became stern and cold. When the time came to set off on my own, I escaped his rigid teachings, carrying the warmth of my mother's spirit. With an indomitable will and a fighter's spirit, I embarked on my adventures as a wandering warrior, honoring Kodlak's plea to help others control the blood of the wolf.",
