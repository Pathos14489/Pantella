    "bio": "Veren Duleri is a Dunmer priest of Vaermina residing at Nightcaller Temple.\r\nHelping Erandur battle through Nightcaller Temple in search of the Skull of Corruption, the Dragonborn is blocked by Veren and Thorek, who label Erandur, a former priest of Vaermina, a \"traitor.\" He immediately becomes hostile and attacks the two on sight.\r\nVeren Duleri: \"We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.\" Veren Duleri: \"Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.\" Veren Duleri: \"We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina.\" Veren Duleri: \"Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary.\" Veren Duleri: \"Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!\"\r\nVeren Duleri: \"No thanks to you, Casimir.\" Veren Duleri: \"You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.\" Veren Duleri: \"Enough of your lies! I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara.\"",
