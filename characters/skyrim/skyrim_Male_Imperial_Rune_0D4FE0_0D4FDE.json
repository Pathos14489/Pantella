    "bio": "Rune is an Imperial thief and a member of the Thieves Guild in Riften.\r\nAs a child, Rune washed up on shore after a shipwreck near Solitude and was found by a local fisherman. Rune could not recall his past, but the fisherman found a rock with strange writing on it. The fisherman named him Rune and raised him, but he later left to discover his past. He admits that most of the coin he makes working for the Guild has been spent in vain trying to uncover his past.\r\nNear the ladder leading out of the Thieves Guild Cistern, on the shelf of one of the cupboards, a note entitled No Word Yet can be found, which details the failure of a certain Athel Newberry's attempts to locate any details of his past.",
