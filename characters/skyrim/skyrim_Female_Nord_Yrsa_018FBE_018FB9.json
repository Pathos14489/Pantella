    "bio": "Yrsa, a young Nord woman, lives in the Skaal village at the northeast corner of Solstheim. She is the wife of Deor Woodcutter. She wears a thick Skaal coat with matching boots and hat. Fanari Strong-Voice is the leader of the village. Fanari was chosen to become leader after her predecessor (Skaf the Giant) died.\r\nYrsa was recently trapped under the mental enslavement of Miraak, being forced into a trance-like stance in which she and Oslaf (who is the husband of Finna and father of a young girl named Aeta) were forced to build a strange structure around the Tree Stone, on top of Miraak\u2019s Temple in the center of Solstheim. Fortunately, Miraak's spell on Yrsa and Oslaf was broken as a result of the player's actions within Miraak\u2019s Temple, after which Yrsa and Oslaf returned to the Skaal Village. While this was happening, most of the other members of the village (including Yrsa\u2019s husband Deor) were also being mentally dominated by Miraak\u2019s spell, but were instead sent to build a mysterious structure around the Wind Stone to the west of the Skaal village. Fortunately, the player broke Miraak\u2019s spell over the villages at the Wind Stone as well. \r\nYrsa occasionally makes snowberry pies, which the villagers (especially Oslaf) think are delicious.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I fear what would have happened if you hadn't freed us.\"\r\n\"The Dark Elves of Raven Rock keep to their city, and we Skaal keep to our village.\"\r\n\"Fanari speaks her mind, perhaps more than she should.\"\r\n\"The Skaal and the land are one, joined by the All-Maker.\"",
