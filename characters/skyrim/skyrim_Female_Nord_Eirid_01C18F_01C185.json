Eirid stays inside her house almost all the time, and sleeps in the basement at night.\r\nAs there are no other children to play with in Winterhold, she plays with Assur, though she is not fond of him, saying that he's mean, and wants to play games she doesn't like to play. She also doesn't like that he hates the mages from the College, who she thinks are nice.\r\nIt is possible for her to send hired thugs after the Dragonborn if they steal from The Frozen Hearth.",
