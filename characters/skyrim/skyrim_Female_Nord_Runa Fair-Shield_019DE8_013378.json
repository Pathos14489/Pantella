    "bio": "Runa Fair-Shield is a Nord orphan living in the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. She is the only girl out of the five children at the orphanage, now four, after Aventus Aretino ran away. If Hearthfire is installed, she is one of the children who can be adopted.\r\nLike the other orphans, she has suffered terribly for some time under the relentless cruelty of Grelod the Kind. If Grelod is killed, Runa admits that things are now better for her, but is still sick of orphanage life and hopes to be adopted.\r\nGrelod \"Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?\" Grelod \"And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Nobody needs you, nobody wants you. That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you'll always be here, until you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world. Now, what do you all say?\" Runa \"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.\"",
