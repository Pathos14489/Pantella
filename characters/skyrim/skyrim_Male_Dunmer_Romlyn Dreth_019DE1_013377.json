    "bio": "Romlyn Dreth is a Dunmer bootlegger in Riften. He can be found in his house in Riften, which is \"under\" the city. When not at home, he is either at Black-Briar Meadery or the Bee and Barb.\r\nSpeak to Romlyn Dreth to smuggle a Black-Briar Mead Keg to Wilhelm in Ivarstead. Alternatively, it is possible to report him to Indaryn, the meadery brewmaster. If reported, he will become resentful of the Dragonborn.\r\nIndaryn: \"Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again.\" Romlyn: \"What are you saying? You think I had something to do with that?\" Romlyn: \"The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn.\" Indaryn: \"For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller.\"\r\nRomlyn: \"So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?\" Indaryn: \"If you think I'd would make a move like that without asking Maven, you're out of your mind. Doing that would be a fatal mistake.\" Romlyn: \"Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!\" Indaryn: \"If you want to go out to Whiterun and burn that meadery down, go right ahead. And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea.\"",
