    "bio": "Averna is the ghost of a long-dead Nord woman. Her incorporeal form has the appearance of a floating wispwother. Because she resides in the dungeons under Dragonsreach, meeting her requires breaking in or out prison. Averna has been able to maintain her existence as a lucid ghost for so long because she still harbors vengeance towards those who wronged her when she was alive.",
