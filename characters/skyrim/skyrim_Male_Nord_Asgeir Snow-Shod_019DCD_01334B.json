    "bio": "Asgeir Snow-Shod, a Nord man, is a prominent citizen of Riften. He has blond hair and a beard. He works as Maven Black-Briar\u2019s investor and business parter at the Black-Briar Meadery, and is typically found in his office there during the day.\r\nAsgeir, along with the other Snow-Shods, mourns the relatively recent loss of his younger sister Lilija, a Stormcloak battle-maid who was killed in battle against the Imperial Legion. Asgeir has a brother named Unmid who serves as a housecarl to Jarl Laila Law-Giver. Asgeir's mother Nura is a priestess of Talos. Asgeir's father Vulwulf is the owner of Snow-Shod Farm to the southwest of Riften, but doesn't do much actual work these days and spends a lot of time drinking at the Bee and Barb, a popular inn in the center of Riften. \r\nAsgeir is currently engaged to be married to a beautiful Imperial woman named Vittoria Vici (who is a cousin of Emperor Titus Mede the Second), as the result of an arrangement between the Vici family and Snow-Shod clan, which is seen more as a political move to broker peace between the warring factions of the Skyrim Civil War.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cMy sister Lilija served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks. We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it. Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things.\"\r\n\"My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda. My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.\"\r\n\u201cDon't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly. I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war. I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen. I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents \"lose\" another child.\"\r\n\u201cI'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground. We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us. My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course.\"\r\n\u201cI'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman.\"\r\n",
