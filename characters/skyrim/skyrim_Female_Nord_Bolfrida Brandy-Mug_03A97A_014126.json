She will pay gold to those who assist her in harvesting the wheat from her farm.\r\nShe likes to think of creative ways to make crops grow more effectively in cold weather. She is friendly to visitors. She loves her job and keeps a positive attitude.\r\nShe employs a practical Dunmer man named Faryl Atheron at her farm.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?\"\r\n\"Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.\"\r\n\"The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow.\"",
