    "bio": "Olfrid Battle-Born, an older Nord man, is the patriarch of the Battle-Born clan in Whiterun.\r\nHe is married to Bergritte Battle-Born and together they have a son named Jon, and a daughter named Alfhild. Alfhild is married to a man named Idolaf, and together they have a child named Lars, who is Olfrid's grandson. Olfrid's clan owns Battle-Born Farm, located directly east of Whiterun's city walls.\r\nJust like most members of the Battle-Born family, Olfrid strongly dislikes the Gray-Mane clan, though he does not dispute that they are one of the most respected clans in all of Skyrim.\r\nOlfrid claims that the Battle-Born are rich due to their largely successful farm, and that the Gray-Manes are jealous of his clan's success, resulting in the feud.\r\nOlfrid may secretly hire the Thieves Guild to save his dear friend Arn, alongside whom he fought in the Great War against the Aldermi Dominion thirty years ago, by forging a new identity for Arn in the prison records.",
