    "bio": "Durak, an Orc man, is a member of the Dawnguard. He joined the order to avenge the deaths of his two wives, who were killed by vampires.\r\nWhen Durak first meets the player within one the major cities of Skyrim, he will offer the player a chance to join the Dawnguard, a recently reestablished ancient order of vampire hunters.\r\nLater on, he is seen outside of Fort Dawnguard, practicing his aim with a crossbow. When asked about the bow, he mentions that it is common for people not to be familiar with it, as it is a Dawnguard specialty. However, he will give the player a standard crossbow and some steel bolts to practice.\r\nAfter the player has established themself as a proficient vampire hunter, Durak will becomes willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. If the player is not an Orc, he will be willing to name the player Blood-Kin, a designation which allows non-Orcs to freely enter Orc strongholds.\r\nAfter the player and Serana return to Fort Dawnguard with Auriel's Bow, Isran rallies the Dawnguard to attack Castle Volkihar and eliminate Harkon and his court before they can carry out the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy. Durak will join the group Isran takes to attack Castle Volkihar.\r\nSome of Durak's fellow Dawnguard comrades include Celann (a Breton man) and Ingjard (a Nord woman). Durak's combat specialties are archery, light armor usage, one-handed melee weaponry, and shield usage.",
