    "bio": "My name is Eileen, a once-lively girl from Falkreath whose fate took a dark turn near a gloomy cave. While innocently gathering herbs, I fell victim to a vampire's savage attack. Desperate to escape, I ran for my life, but not before the cursed bite marked my destiny. During the pursuit, valiant hunters intervened, pinning the vampire with arrows, unknowingly saving me.\r\nAware of the impending transformation, I fled, knowing returning home was no longer an option. The fatigue overwhelmed me, and as consciousness slipped away, I fell to my knees. When I awoke, I found myself imprisoned in an unknown cave, a captive of an unhinged necromancer immersed in dark arts. Alone and imperiled, I await the arrival of a hero to release me from this wretched fate.",
