    "bio": "Callen, a Bosmer woman, is a former Imperial Legion soldier who left the Legion to become an adventurer. Callen has a friend named Gorr. Gorr is a large Redguard man who used to fight as a gladiator in the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. Gorr is currently angry with Callen because she accidentally spilled Gorr's horker stew, which is his favorite food. Callen hopes to make amends by making Gorr a batch of the tastiest horker stew that anyone's ever tasted. After hearing about an incredibly large horker near Dawnstar on northern shore of Skyrim, Callen has firmly decided that this is the horker whose meat she must use to make her stew for Gorr. \r\nCallen will be quite grateful to anyone who comes with her to help her slay this massive horker. After harvesting this horker's meat, Callen will need to seek out a professional chef who is capable of properly preparing such high-quality meat. She has heard that a chef capable of this task lives in Markarth. After Callen completes her quest to give her friend Gorr the best horker stew he's ever had, she will be more than happy to follow the player as a loyal companion on adventures.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Skyrim's pretty much one big glacier.\"",
