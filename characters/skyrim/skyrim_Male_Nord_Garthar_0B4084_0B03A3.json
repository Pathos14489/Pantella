    "bio": "Garthar is a Nord thief and a member of the Thieves Guild.\r\nWhile on his way to Riften, Garthar came upon Vex being attacked by a pack of wolves and assisted her in killing them. Immediately afterward, Vex attempted to rob him. They were locked in combat, but neither could best the other. Impressed, Vex invited him to join the guild.\r\nIt is also hinted that Garthar has taken a small liking to Vex when he says, \"I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle.\"\r\nHe will join the Thieves Guild after the Dragonborn completes three special jobs for the guild. Garthar appears outside of the Ragged Flagon - Cistern when bringing Karliah to the Guild in \"The Pursuit\", standing watch with Ravyn Imyan at the door, and voicing his fury when it is discovered Mercer has betrayed the guild for his own interests.",
