    "bio": "She is the ghost of an ancient Nord warrior. Many thousands of years ago, she died and was buried within Ysgramor's Tomb, along with Ysgramor and his fellow Companion warriors. Ysgramor's tomb is located on an island in the icy waters of the Sea of Ghosts, near the city of Winterhold on Skyrim's northeastern shore.\r\nMany Companion ghosts are currently patroling the halls of this tomb, having recently been awakened. Their purpose is to test the combat worthiness of some of the modern-day members of the Companions, who have recently entered the tomb complex. Companion ghosts wield a variety of spectral weapons, such as bows, swords, shields, and battleaxes. Despite the ethereal nature of these weapons, they are still capable of inflicting real physical damage. Likewise, these ghosts can be harmed and defeated with normal weapons.\r\nDespite being resolved to attack any living souls that enter the tomb, these ghosts bear no ill will towards the living. The ghosts are simply committed to properly assessing the combat strength and worthiness of these living Companion visitors.",
