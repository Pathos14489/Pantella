    "bio": "Willem works as a miner in Left Hand Mine. After finishing his workday, he resides in the miner's barracks, in the settlement outside the mine.\r\nLeft Hand Mine is located in the Reach, near Markarth. Like the buildings in Markarth, the majority of the structures in this settlement are of ancient Dwarven stone construction. Left Hand Mine is on opposite side from Markarth of one of the main tributaries of the Karth River. Several bridges cross the river in this area. This river is the main water source for both the city of Markarth and the Left Hand Mine settlement.\r\nKolskeggr Mine (located a moderate distance to the northeast of Left Hand Mine), was recently attacked by the Forsworn. These Forsworn raiders massacred all the miners except a man named Pavo and an orc named Gat, who managed to escape the slaughter. Pavo and Gat are temporarily staying in the Left Hand Mine miner\u2019s barracks until it is safe for them to return home.\r\nAt work, Willem primarily mines from iron ore veins. He is employed by Skaggi Scar-Face, a Nord man who is married to Sosia.\r\nWillem is not the talkative type. He prefers to focus on his work and keep to himself. Ethnically, he is a Reachman - a descendant of the original native inhabitants of the Reach. He has short hair, and tends to be relatively clean-shaven.",
