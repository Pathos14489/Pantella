    "bio": "Nelos isn\u2019t all that he seems to be. He is a Dunmer. He is haunted by the dreams of a prophecy called the Long Night. He began experiencing these dreams as child, living in the canalworks of Vivec city in Morrowind. A book written about the prophecy of the Long Night recounts it as follows: \"Seven days since the sun last rose upon a blackened sky the stars grow cold. When twin moons merge upon the sun the longest night begins with one. The womb of fate from whence he came and armies gather in shadow's name. From sundered earth bursts hollow bones and from broken skin come bestial groans. Fire threads through illusive skies while veins are pinched by shiver's cries. Light fades and shadows restore from dawn to dark and nevermore. The knells of loss sing the axeman's song live to mourn for the night is long.\"\r\nWhen conversed with, Drelas is likely to talk about his philosophy, as well as about his friend Brenil as well as Brenil\u2019s stubborn daughter Olivia, who currently teaches at the College of Winterhold. Drelas is the leader of the Radiant Dark, a splinter group of independently-thinking mages. The main distinguishing philosophy shared by the members of the Radiant Dark is the idea that the strong deserve to rule over the weak.\r\nNelos recently spent some time in Drelas' cottage, in the hills between the Whiterun plains to the south, and the Skyborn Range mountains to the north. During this time, Nelos was pretending to actually be Drelas (another male Dunmer mage) - the real Drelas... is no longer around.\r\nNelos now resides deep within the Radiant Dark Fortress, with the other members of the Radiant Dark. This fortress is located in a remote snowy region of Haafingar.\r\nNelos is aware of the fact that the player is the Dragonborn. He recognizes the Dragonborn's power, and wants them to join the Radiant Dark.",
