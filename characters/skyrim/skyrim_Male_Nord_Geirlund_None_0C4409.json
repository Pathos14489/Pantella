    "bio": "Geirlund is a Nord warrior found at Northwatch Keep.\r\nGeirlund appears in the side quest Missing in Action. He, along with another Nord named Vidrald, are recruited by Avulstein Gray-Mane to assist in the assault on Northwatch Keep to free Thorald Gray-Mane from the Thalmor. This only happens if Avulstein's help is requested in the quest. If Geirlund survives rescuing Thorald, he remains at Northwatch Keep with Vidrald, and can be found either in the courtyard, or in the prison area protecting the Thalmor's other prisoners. He is usually seen armed with an iron warhammer and hide armor.",
