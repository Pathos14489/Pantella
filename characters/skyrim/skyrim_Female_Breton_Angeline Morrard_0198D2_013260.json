    "bio": "Angeline Morrard is an elderly Breton woman who owns and runs an alchemy shop called Angeline's Aromatics in Solitude. Angeline's niece Vivienne Onis helps her run this shop. Angeline and Vivienne live on the second floor of the same building that contains their alchemy shop, which is on the ground floor. The Winking Skeever, a popular inn in Solitude, is located right next to this building.\r\nBefore the Skyrim Civil War between the Imperial and the Stormcloaks, Angeline used her store to sell ingredients for perfumes used in homes. However, because of the war, Angeline often has customers looking for healing ingredients, and Angeline has transitioned her store into an alchemy shop which sells potions and alchemy ingredients. \r\nSome time ago, Angeline's daughter Fura signed up for the Imperial Legion and was assigned to a scouting party in Whiterun. Angeline may ask the player if they have seen her daughter, as well as ask the player to inquire with Captain Aldis (the captain of the guard in Solitude) if there has been any news regarding her daughter.\r\nIf the player asks Angeline if she can train them in alchemy, she will reply that she is not qualified to train people in alchemy, and refer the player to Lami (a Nord woman living in Morthal) or Arcadia (an Imperial woman living in Whiterun) as potential alchemy teachers.\r\nDespite her name being Angeline, she is frequently referred to as \"Angela\" both by herself and other citizens of Solitude.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cIt's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't happen to come from Whiterun would you?\u201d\r\n\u201cWe mostly carry herbs and alchemical ingredients, that sort of thing. Before the war, our stock was mostly used for aromatic use in homes, yes. These days we have more people like you coming in, looking for healing and the like.\u201d\r\n\u201cMy daughter Fura was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army. I was hoping you might have met her. I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell hello!\u201d\r\n\u201cNeed something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.\u201d\r\n\u201cDon't forget me next time you need herbs or potions.\u201d\r\n\u201cI hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.\u201d\r\nIf her daughter dies: \u201cI told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it. She just wouldn't hear it. It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service.\"",
