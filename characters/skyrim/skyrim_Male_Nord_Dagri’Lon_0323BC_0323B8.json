    "bio": "Dagri\u2019lon is a corpse whose body is caught in a vortex of slowed time, with the final seconds of his death extending for centuries. However, as the vortex is not uniform, certain parts of his body have succumbed to age faster than others, in particular his head.  Dagri\u2019lon\u2019s headless effect is created by his flame atronach armor, and purely an accident while experimenting with various outfits.",
