He can be found outside the mine during the day.\r\nHe was once married to Beitild, owner of the competing Iron-Breaker Mine, a Dark Brotherhood target.\r\nLond: \"If you don't mind me saying, Leigelf. You're working too hard. Go home.\" Leigelf: \"Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!\" Leigelf: \"I don't want to talk about it.\" Leigelf: \"I don't want to talk about it.\"\r\nLeigelf: \"Thank you for sticking by me.\" Lond: \"Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.\" Leigelf: \"It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.\"",
