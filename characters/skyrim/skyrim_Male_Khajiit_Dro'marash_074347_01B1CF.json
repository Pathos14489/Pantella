    "bio": "Dro'marash is a Khajiit warrior. He travels across Skyrim as part of a trading caravan, along with a few other Khajiit. Dro'marash and Kharjo (males) work as mercenaries protecting Ahkari and Zaynabi (females), who handle the actual merchant aspects of their trading operation. In addition to common goods, Khajiit caravans deal in exotic goods and items, sometimes from other parts of Tamriel. Such things can be difficult for people in Skyrim to acquire otherwise, especially since the outbreak of Skyrim's currently ongoing civil war between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak rebellion. Khajiit caravans also buy goods from anyone willing to sell to them at a bargain price, in hopes of later selling such goods at profit.\r\nThere are three Khajiit caravan groups currently operating in Skyrim. Dro'marash works for the group led by Ahkari. Ri'saad is the entrepreneurial founder and leader of the entire Khajiit trading caravan operation in Skyrim, and he currently leads the group covering the route between Whiterun and Markarth. Ri'saad has assigned each of the three caravan groups a separate trading route that travels back and forth between different cities in Skyrim. Ahkari's caravan travels back and forth between Dawnstar (a smaller port city in icy northern Skyrim) and Riften (a city on the shore of Lake Honrich in southeastern Skyrim, surrounded by temperate forests). They occasionally encounter Ma'dran's caravan on the northern segment of their route, as Ma'dran travels between Solitude and Windhelm.\r\nSuspicions born of negative racial stereotypes have caused the people of Skyrim to forbid Khajiit caravans from entering their cities, so the caravans must make camp outside the city walls and conduct their trading business there. This policy applies only to the caravans; individual Khajiit citizens can be encountered within Skyrim's cities on rare occasion.\r\nDespite being a warrior and not usually being particularly talkative, Dro'marash is skilled in the art of persuasive speaking. For a fee, he may be willing to impart some of his knowledge of this art.\r\nDro'marash is experienced with fighting in heavy armor, as well as with a sword. He currently wears a set of steel armor, and carries a sword and a shield.\r\nLike most Khajiit, Dro'marash speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
