    "bio": "Ogdul is a farmer from Rorikstead. He used to be a bandit, but quit due to the influence of Cassius, an imperial noble who he and his fellows had captured. Cassius was a naive, young man who wanted to try and reform the bandits. Cassius had books with him about farming, selling loot etc, that Ogdul and the other bandits would read every night aloud for cheap laughs. Ogdul relates they started to call Cassius the \u2018Arch Mage of Snowberrie\u2019 as an insult. However, he also admits that he was actually secretly listening to the contents of the books as they were read out. The contents of the books inspired him to sneak away, stop banditry and build a new life as a farmer. Before he fled, he gave Cassius a vial of poison so \u2018at least he could go out on his own terms\u2019. Ogdul now says he has had more than enough life of excitement and is content living an honest life as a farmer, admitting that before he was lying to himself that he couldn\u2019t make enough money in this new profession. He simply had lacked the knowledge and robbing people had been an easier route until he saw a different path in life.",
