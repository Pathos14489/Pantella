    "bio": "Hrongar, a Nord man, lives in Whiterun. He is the younger brother of Jarl Balgruuf, the ruler of Whiterun. Hrongar often gets into disagreements with the Jarl's steward, a meek Imperial man named Proventus Avenicci. Hrongar can usually be found sitting at the table in Dragonsreach, eating, or aimlessly walking the halls.\r\nHrongar is a devoted warrior and adherent of Nord customs and traditions. Any verbal attack made against him\u00a0(most notably by Proventus Avenicci) is met with anger. He is not, however, a supporter of the Stormcloaks, often voicing his support of the Empire and how Whiterun should take the fight to the Stormcloaks instead of sitting around and waiting.",
