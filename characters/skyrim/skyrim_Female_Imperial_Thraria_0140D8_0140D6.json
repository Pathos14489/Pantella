    "bio": "Thraria lives in Riften, where she works at Mistveil Keep, the jarl's palace. From this palace, Jarl Laila Law-Giver (a middle-aged woman) governs over Riften and the rest of The Rift (of which Riften is the capital).\r\nJarl Laila has two adult sons: Harrald and Saerlund. Saerlund is not allowed to leave Mistveil Keep due to his public criticism of Ulfric Stormcloak, the leader of the Stormcloak rebellion against the Empire.\r\nA man named Unmid Snow-Shod is the jarl's personal housecarl. A female Bosmer named Anuriel is the jarl's court steward. Anuriel and Unmid are in a romantic relationship. Another female Bosmer named Wylandriah is the jarl's eccentric court mage.\r\nMaven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the incredibly wealthy and influential Black-Briar family, very arguably holds more real power than Jarl Laila does.\r\nIf the Imperial Legion seizes control of Riften during the course of the Skyrim civil war, Jarl Laila, her family, Anuriel, and Unmid will be forced into exile at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm.\r\nThraria is a young Imperial woman with green eyes and long brown hair. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit. She spends most of her working hours serving food and drinks to the inhabitants of the palace, as well as to important visitors.",
