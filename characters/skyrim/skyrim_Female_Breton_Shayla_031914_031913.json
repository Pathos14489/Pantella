    "bio": "Shayla lives in Kynesgrove, a small town south of the city of Windhelm. She works as a barmaid at the Braidwood Inn. Her employer is the innkeeper, a middle-aged woman named Iddra. Iddra is married to Kjeld, who owns and manages the nearby Steamscorch Mine. Iddra and Kjeld have a teenage son named Kjeld the Younger and a young daughter named Froa. An Imperial woman named Arlina also works at the inn as a barmaid, and additionally helps to coordinate the renting of rooms.\r\nThe Velothi Mountains to the east loom over the town. Steamscorch Mine, from which malachite ore is mined, is Kynesgrove's main point of interest. Travelers on their way south towards Riften, or on their way north towards Windhelm, often stay at the Braidwood Inn.\r\nShayla is a Breton woman with brown hair and light blue eyes. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Shayla walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
