    "bio": "Orenius is a retired Penitus Oculatus agent who once was responsible for training new recruits. He provides background information on the Penitus Oculatus as well as the Raven of Anvil. The Raven of Anvil is the story of a master thief known as the Raven who assuaged the grief of a Countess with a solemn dirge, only to steal her valuables as she slept. If he feels comfortable he will reveal that his chase of the Raven is based on personal ties to the thief. Orenius also overstates the Empire\u2019s dedication to cracking down on Talos worship, implying he is not only out of the loop, but has been sent on missions to assist the Thalmor, likely as a way of removing his presence from the Oculatus while irritating their Elven counterparts.",
