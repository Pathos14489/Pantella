    "bio": "Ghamorz is an Orc who lives in Orc stronghold of Mor Khazgur, at the base of the Druadach Mountains in western Skyrim.\r\nGhamorz spends most of his time working in the stronghold's nearby orichalcum mine. Gul (female) and Olur (male) are some of his fellow miners. Ghamorz typically wears a pair of ragged trousers and boots, and usually has his mining pickaxe with him. He is particularly enthusiastic about following the Code of Malacath.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out.\"\r\n\"I have metal to dig.\"\r\n\"Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.\"\r\n\"Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.\"\r\n\"The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge.\"",
