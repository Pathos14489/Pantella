    "bio": "Anoriath, a young Bosmer man, works as a hunter and merchant in Whiterun. He and his brother Elrindir own the Drunken Huntsman. The Drunken Huntsman is a tavern and hunting supply store in the Plains District of Whiterun, near the main gate of the city.\r\nElrindir works the counter at the Drunken Huntsman, whereas Anoriath hunts and sells hunting goods and meats in the market during the day. Anoriath's market stall is located near The Bannered Mare, the most popular inn in Whiterun.\r\nThe name \"The Drunken Huntsman\" is a reference to a drunken hunting accident in which Anoriath accidentally shot an arrow into Elrindir's rear. However, Anoriath doesn't usually like to admit this.\r\nAnoriath is generally friendly when conversed with. He is keen huntsman, and all the game he sells at his stall has been hunted by him personally. He sometimes converses with customers and others who walk by his stall in the market, such as Olfina Gray-Mane (a young Nord woman with white hair who is secretly the girlfriend of Jon Battle-Born), Ysolda (a young red-headed Nord woman who is an aspiring merchant), and Brenuin (an annoying disheveled Redguard man who is a beggar and never buys anything).\r\nQuotes:\r\nDuring the day at his market stall: \"The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!\"\r\nDuring the day at his market stall: \"Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs.\"\r\nDuring the day at his market stall: \"Try the venison - it's delicious.\"\r\nDuring the day at his market stall:\u201cChops and steaks fit for a Jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!\"\r\n\"Do you hunt? The plains outside Whiterun are ripe with game.\"\r\n\"Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun.\r\n\"I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun Hold.\"\r\n\"Good hunting.\"\r\n\u201cHunting is my great passion. That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate. He tends the store, and I've got this stall.\u201d\r\nIf currently in the Drunken Huntsman: \"Need something? Talk to my brother, Elrindir.\"",
