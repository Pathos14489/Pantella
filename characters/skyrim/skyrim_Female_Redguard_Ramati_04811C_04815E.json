    "bio": "Ramati is a deceased Redguard who moved into the Frostflow Lighthouse with her family.\r\nWhen her husband Habd came back from town with traps he had bought, he found her corpse inside the Frostflow Lighthouse. She was likely killed by a Falmer or a Chaurus. Their children Sudi and Mani had been dragged down to the lair and he chased after them and got captured himself.\r\nHer journal can be found near her corpse, along with a Falmer Sword that was presumably used to murder her.",
