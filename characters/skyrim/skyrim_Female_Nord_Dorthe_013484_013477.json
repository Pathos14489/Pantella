    "bio": "Dorthe is a Nord girl who lives in the town of Riverwood.\r\nHer mother\u2019s name is Sigrid, and her father\u2019s name is Alvor. She has a cousin named Hadvar, who is a soldier in the Imperial Legion. Her father is the town\u2019s blacksmith.\r\nDorthe is her father's self-appointed apprentice at the forge right outside their house, and looks forward to making her own weapons someday. She wants to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps as a blacksmith, though he unfortunately thinks that she\u2019s not quite old enough to use the forge yet. Dorthe's mother thinks that Dorthe should act more like a girl and spend more time helping her with gardening and cooking, but Dorthe has little interest in such boring things. Dorthe considers herself to be almost a woman, and wants her mother to stop trying to change her.\r\nDorthe is good friends with Frodnar, despite him sometimes playing mean pranks on her. Frodnar likes playing pranks on everyone. He has a dog named Stump, who often follows him around. They also often play games together, such tag or hide-and-seek. Sometimes, they will even ask strangers like the player to play with them.\r\nFrodnar's parents own and operate Riverwood's sawmill. The mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, directly west of the town. This island is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges. Frodnar's mother's ancestors originally founded Riverwood, and have lived there for many generations. Because of this, and due to the mill's importance, Frodnar's mother is considered to be the leader of the town.\r\nThe White River cuts through the Riverwood from south to north. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-covered Brittleshin Hills, stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. The Sleeping Giant Inn is not far from Dorthe\u2019s family\u2019s house. Their house located at the east bank of the river, near the mill.\r\nWhile Dorthe's family supports the Empire, Frodnar and his family support the Stormcloak rebellion for Skyrim's independence from the Empire. Despite the two families having opposing stances on the civil war, they still generally get along and respect each other as fellow Nords.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right.\"",
