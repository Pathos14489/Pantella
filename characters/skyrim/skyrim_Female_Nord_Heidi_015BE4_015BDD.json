Honningbrew is a newly established competitor to the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften. Honningbrew Meadery is small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality. The smaller front section of the meadery serves as a tavern that serves mead to customers directly, while the larger back section is where the mead is actually produced and stored. In addition to Honningbrew mead, the tavern also offers customers food and other drinks.\r\nSabjorn\u2019s senior assistant is an Imperial man named Mallus, and his junior assistant is a young man named Eimar.
