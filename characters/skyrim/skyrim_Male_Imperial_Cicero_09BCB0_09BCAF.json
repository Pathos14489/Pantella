    "bio": "Cicero, an Imperial man, has the appearance and personality of an eccentric jester. Cicero is the Keeper of the Dark Brotherhood, and one of his responsibilities is to take care of the Night Mother's coffin. He may originally be encountered on the road north of Whiterun, near Loreius Farm, transporting the coffin of the Night Mother (Cicero refers to her simply as \"Mother\"). Cicero will beseech the player to aid him, stating he needs repairs for his wagon wheel. After this encounter, he may be found within the Dark Brotherhood\u2019s Falkreath Sanctuary or the Dark Brotherhood\u2019s Dawnstar Sanctuary.\r\nThe Night Mother is the Unholy Matron, bride of Sithis, and spiritual leader of the Dark Brotherhood. Despite being a powerful spirit, her corpse is needed for communion with her. She receives prayers from people seeking to arrange assassinations via the Black Sacrament, and relays those desires to the Listener, the mortal leader of the Brotherhood. However, since the destruction of the Brotherhood in Cyrodiil, and the death of the Listener in a riot, the Dark Brotherhood has been cut off from contact with the Night Mother. Without a Listener to guide the Dark Brotherhood in the way that the Night Mother wishes, Astrid has foolishly and greedily taken complete control of the Brotherhood for herself. Astrid and the other Brotherhood members have rejected the tenets and traditions of the Dark Brotherhood, which Cicero views as a sacrilege. Although the Night Mother is no longer respected as she once was, Cicero has a plan to help change this and restore the Brotherhood to its former glory.\r\nCicero was once a member of the Bruma Sanctuary of the Dark Brotherhood before it was destroyed, and later a member of the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. Cicero was renowned for his cloak-and-dagger killing style. Cicero\u2019s journal mention riots in Bravil leading to the death of Alisanne Dupre (the Night Mother's previous Listener) and the desecration of the Night Mother's crypt beneath The Lucky Old Lady statue. After being voted into the role of Keeper of the Night Mother by the remaining Brotherhood members, Cicero fulfilled one last contract before starting his new duties; he was scheduled to kill a jester, with whom he slowly became obsessed. His attire and flamboyant manner mimic this jester. Over time, Cicero has descended into madness, obsessing over this jester and adopting aspects of the jester's persona.\r\nEventually, through the months after the last Listener's death, the remaining Brotherhood members left the Sanctuary to look for contracts or food and never returned, leaving Cicero trapped alone in the Cheydinal Sanctuary. Eventually, he grew more and more insane from obsessing over his last kill, isolation, and due to trying to talk to the Night Mother and become her Listener. Eight years later, he wrote letters to Astrid in Skyrim to appeal for sanctuary, fleeing from the Cheydinhal sanctuary to Skyrim, taking the Night Mother's coffin with him.\r\nWidely regarded as bothersome, obnoxious, strange, and insane, Cicero sports flamboyant attire and often speaks with a high-pitched voice. Cicero speaks to both himself and the Night Mother's remains often, and as such, he is considered psychotic. As Keeper of the Night Mother, Cicero takes his vocation very seriously, willing to wound or even kill anyone who questions or ignores the Night Mother's authority.\r\nCicero wants to be the Listener, but despite his best efforts and repeated attempts at conversation with the Night Mother\u2019s corpse, he cannot hear her voice like the Listener must be able to do. If the player tells Cicero that they have started hearing the Night Mother\u2019s voice, Cicero will declare the player to be the new Listener. While Cicero will initially be bitter that he was not made Listener, he will still be excited that that there is a new Listener, and will congratulate the player on their new role. \r\nLater, in a fit of defiance, Cicero will attack Astrid for challenging the Night Mother's authority, but fail to kill her. After surviving a skirmish with Veezara (an Argonian, and former member of the Shadowscales group of Argonian assassinsa, Cicero will flee to the Dawnstar Sanctuary, with Arnbjorn following close behind. Arriving outside the Dawnstar Sanctuary, Cicero will stab Arnbjorn, causing him to bleed heavily, but not enough to kill him. Before escaping into the sanctuary, Arnbjorn will also wound Cicero, but not enough to kill him. At this point, the player will have to decide whether or not to kill Cicero, and Cicero will try to convince the player to spare his life.\r\nIf following the player on their journeys across Skyrim, he makes several off-beat jokes and humorous observations about the current location or quest. While not following the player, he lurks around the sanctuary near the Night Mother's sarcophagus, talking to himself and tending her.\r\nCicero will often, for no reason, start to dance. This can happen at any time and anywhere.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf the player asks if they can help him with his wagon problem: \u201cOh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help! Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses! Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!\u201d\r\n\u201cIs there singing in the Void? Dancing...? Surely the Dread Lord will at least allow poor Cicero to caper\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cCicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy...\u201d\r\n\u201cNeed to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers...\u201d\r\n\"Let's kill someone.\"\r\n\"Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment...\"\r\n\u201cHumble Cicero lives to serve.\"\r\nIf asked about the duties of the Keeper: \"Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.\"\r\nIf the player has been named the Listener: \u201cCicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!\u201d\r\nIf in Solitude: \u201cHmph. 'Solitude'. Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude...\u201d\r\nIf in Markarth: \u201cForsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...\u201d\r\nIf in Riften: \u201cRiften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun.\u201d",
