    "bio": "Arondil is an Altmer man with long blond hair. He is a necromancer and ice mage, experimenting with necroanimus. After being evicted from Dawnstar for his experiments, Arondil took refuge in the icy depths of Yngvild (an ancient Nordic ruin on an island northeast of Dawnstar), where he endeavors to \"reanimate and enslave the dead.\" Arondil has an obsession with the young milkmaids of Dawnstar and has found a way to bolster his already unique entirely female draugr entourage with their reanimated specters, the Yngvild Ghosts.\r\nArondil is the author of four journals, which can be found on tables within his lair. The journals paint a highly disturbing image of the Arondil, and chronicle his actions thoroughly.",
