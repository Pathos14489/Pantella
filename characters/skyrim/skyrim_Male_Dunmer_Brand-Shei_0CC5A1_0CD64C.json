    "bio": "Brand-Shei, a Dunmer man, is a shopkeeper in Riften. During the day, he sells a variety of goods at his stall in Riften\u2019s Grand Plaza market square. At night, he sleeps in Haelga\u2019s Bunkhouse, a popular lodging facility for the workers of Riften.\r\nHe sells various ingots, soul gems, jewelry, potions, weapons, and armor. He also sells specialty goods from Morrowind that other general goods merchants don\u2019t sell.\r\nOrphaned as a child and raised by Argonians from a very early age, Brand-Shei believes that he originally came from the House Telvanni in Morrowind. He has traced his ancestry back to a maid of House Telvanni, who escaped during an Argonian invasion.  Brand-Shei may ask the player to investigate the wreck of a ship named The Pride of Tel Vos, in order to learn more about his own past and ancestry.\r\nLike many in Riften, Brand-Shei has an unfavorable opinion of the Black-Briar family and the Thieves Guild, but is fearful of publicly voicing this opinion.\r\nBrand-Shei is on friendly terms with Svana Far-Shield, a young Nord woman who works for her aunt Haelga at Haelga\u2019s Bunkhouse, where Brand-Shei lives and sleeps. Brand-Shei and Svana sometimes discuss Sibbi Black-Briar\u2019s recent murder of a man named Wulfur. Wulfur was the brother of Svidi. Svidi is a young Nord woman who is the mutual acquaintance of Brand-Shei and Svana. Svidi has recently gone missing.\r\nBrand-Shei is on good terms with Mjoll, a Nord woman who is trying to fight against the rampant corruption and crime that plagues Riften.\r\nBrand-Shei sometimes discusses current events with Bolli (a fisherman) or Shadr (works at the Riften stables), such as the recent destruction of Helgen at the hands of a dragon.\r\nTythis Ullen, a Dunmer man who works at the Riften Fishery, buys boots from Brand-Shei unusually often. Tythis has bought 20 pairs of boots from Brand-Shei in the last 2 years.\r\nThere is a rumor that Brand-Shei is in a secret relationship with Haelga, the Nord woman who owns the bunkhouse where Brand-Shei lives. Haelga is infamous in Riften for her sexual promiscuity and fervent Dibella worship. Even if this rumor about Brand-Shei and Haelga is true, Brand-Shei will deny it if questioned about it.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands.\"\r\nIf at his stall in the Riften market: \"Gems, potions, exotic ingredients... I have them all!\"\r\nIf at his stall in the Riften market: \"Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?\"\r\nIf at his stall in the Riften market: \"Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.\"\r\nIf at his stall in the Riften market: \"If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know.\"\r\n\"I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian. Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh. I hope one day to finally find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.\"\r\n\u201cWhen I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni. It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain. I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War. Records show her buying passage aboard a vessel named \"The Pride of Tel Vos,\" but that's where the trail ran cold. I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed. If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for, I'd be grateful.\"\r\nIf the player gives him the journal of Lymdremn Telvanni: \"Let me see that! Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed. Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside. I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.\"\r\nIf inside the Riften Jail: \"This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt! This is unfair! I'm innocent! This is all the work of Brynjolf and the Thieves Guild! I\u2019ve been framed! They stole Madesi\u2019s ring and put it in my pocket!\u201d",
