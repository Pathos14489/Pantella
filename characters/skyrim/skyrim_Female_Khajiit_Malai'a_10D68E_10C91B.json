    "bio": "I am Malai'a, a female Khajiit from Scenchal, way down on the southern tip of Elsweyr. I grew up as sort of a street rat among the slums, dodging the law and stealing to survive. In my youth, my friend was killed in a cross-fire between the guards and a notorious skooma-dealer named Shazz\u2019ra the Scourge. Since then, I\u2019ve been burning for vengeance and a desire to end his drug empire. After completing \u201cSugar and Scurvy\u201d with me, I will be available as a Master Pickpocket Trainer. I will travel with Risaad\u2019s caravan, between Whiterun and Markarth.",
