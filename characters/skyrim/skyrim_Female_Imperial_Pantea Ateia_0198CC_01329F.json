    "bio": "Pantea Ateia, an Imperial woman, is a dean and Master Vocalist at the Bards College in Solitude. In addition to being a master singer, she is also an experienced flute-player. Viarmo (an Altmer man who is the Headmaster of the Bards College) is her superior.\r\nPantea wears a set of high quality fine clothes. She has shoulder-length blond hair.\r\nPantea performed many times for the late High King Torygg at the Blue Palace. Pantea was previously touring the courts around Skyrim, performing for the Jarls across the different Holds, but the rebellion and ensuing civil war in Skyrim has forced her to cancel her tour and return to Solitude.\r\nPantea cannot stand most of her students, as she believes they are wasting her time. Aia Arria (an Imperial woman) is the only one her students who shows true potential.\r\nWhen not at the college, Pantea can sometimes be found performing at the Winking Skeever (a popular tavern/inn), filling in for the Winking Skeever\u2019s usual bard (a Breton woman named Lisette).\r\nPantea may ask the player to recover her flute, which has been passed down in her family for 17 generations. One of her foolish students named Larina stole her flute, ran away, and sold the flute to a necromancer hiding in Hob\u2019s Fall Cave (located in a remote region icy region halfway between Dawnstar and Winterhold). Pantea recently received a ransom note for the flute. Apparently, Larina told the necromancer some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance. In reality, it\u2019s just a really old and valuable flute with no magical abilities. \r\nPantea is scheduled to sing at the reception of the upcoming wedding between Vittoria Vici and Asgeir Snow-Shod. Vittoria is a prominent Solitude businesswoman with the East Empire Company, and is the cousin of the Emperor.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it.\"\r\n\"If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous to travel.\"\r\n\"It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.\"\r\n\"Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.\"\r\n\"To be honest, I can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.\"",
