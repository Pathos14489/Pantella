She has two brothers, Frothar and Nelkir.\r\nLike the other children of Balgruuf the Greater, Dagny has a rather spoiled personality. She may assume the player is a servant.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Absurd that you can't get good sweet rolls in this skeeverhole of a city.\"\r\n\"One of the new servants? Remember that I like my meat rare.\"\r\n\"Blasted war. I was due a new dress from Solitude, but it will never get here.\"\r\n\"I'm so angry, I can hardly stand it! Father promised me a new dress days ago, now where is it?\"",
