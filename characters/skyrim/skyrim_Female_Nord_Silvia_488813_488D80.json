    "bio": "Silvia's my name, a warrior whose life's thread unraveled swiftly, leaving me bare in ways armor never could shield. The Honningbrew Meadery witnessed my fall from grace, from a warrior of renown to a spectacle, my prowess reduced to mere amusement for the mead-drowned patrons. Now within Calliope's Companions, I find myself amidst a dance I never sought, where the sharing of beds and secrets is as common as the clink of coin. By day, I train, my blade cutting the air, each swing a silent scream against the injustices that stripped me of dignity. By night, I partake in the group's rituals, my presence a facade of participation, while inside, a tempest rages - a storm of anger and defiance, a silent vow to never again let my will be stolen. Among these women, I search for fragments of the warrior I once was, the strength to stand amidst the ruin, and perhaps one day, to rebuild.
