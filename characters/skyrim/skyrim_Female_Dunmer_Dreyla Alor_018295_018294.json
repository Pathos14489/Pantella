Just like the other villagers of Raven Rock, she can also be found at the Earth Stone working on it and worshiping it. When she does, she acts and sounds like she has been indoctrinated.\r\nInteracting with her will reveal to the Dragonborn, her background and the death of her mother. Her mother was a priestess of the New Temple sect of her village near Black Marsh. One day Argonians raided their village and her mother was one of the many killed that day. Since then she and her father have opened up a trading shack in the Dunmer colony of Raven Rock providing income for the impoverished town.\r\nUnknown to most, Dreyla has a secret relationship with the captain of the Redoran Guard Captain Veleth but keeps their relationship a secret due to Dreylas father's disapproval. However, Captain Veleth wants Dreyla's father to know the truth, as he states in his note to Dreyla.\r\nDo you know someone called Miraak? \"I think so, but I'm mot sure where I heard the name.\"",
