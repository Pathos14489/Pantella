    "bio": "Azzadal is a deceased Redguard man. In life, he was a bard. He wore traditional Hammerfell/Alik'r clothing and carried a scimitar on his waist. After performing the entirety of the Poetic Edda\", Azzadal tried to jump off Bard's Leap Summit (an overhang at the very top of Lost Valley Redoubt, in the Reach) into a pool below. Unfortunately, he didn't jump far enough and missed the water, hitting the stone ground and dying of his injuries. His ghost sometimes manifests at this pool, briefly speaking to travelers and playing a song.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Been a long time since someone took the leap. Longer still since any survived it. I once performed the entirety of the Poetic Edda from atop Bard's Leap before trying my luck. Well, you can see how that turned out.\"",

It's a Skyrim-ified version of the MaleAltmer_Bosmer_Dunmer_GSaint voice model from Oblivion. It's not a perfect match, but it's the same VA: Craig Sechler"
