    "bio": "Vekel the Man, a Nord man, is a bartender and an associate of the Thieves Guild who lives in Riften.\r\nVekel owns and operates the Ragged Flagon, the tavern within the Ratway. The Ratway is the old sewer and tunnel system under Riften. The Thieves Guild uses the Ragged Flagon and its adjacent cistern as its base of operations. Vekel was once a resident of Honorhall Orphanage, and continually got into trouble for concocting strange and powerful alcoholic drinks. He eventually ran away and saved enough from his burgeoning pickpocket career to afford the tavern.\r\nVekel may ask the player to acquire four rare books from Yngvild Barrow -- the journals of the necromancer, Arondil.\r\nVekel can be asked where Esbern is located, either with a persuasion, intimidation, or by giving him gold. After doing so, he will reveal where the old man Esbern is hiding: within the Ratway Warrens.\r\nVekel is in a romantic relationship with Tonilia, but is frustrated both by her engagement refusals and the rumors of an affair she allegedly has with Brynjolf. However, Tonilia has denied these rumors that she is cheating on Vekel, and will get mad at Vekel if he believes these rumors.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.\"\r\n\u201cI don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here. The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it. Last few years have been pretty bad. I've almost closed this place up.\"\r\n\"I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory\u201d\r\n\"You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.\"\r\n\"There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.\"\r\n\"Don't cause trouble, or else I'll ask Dirge to \"walk\" you out.\"",
