    "bio": "Talvur was a Dunmer miner living in Markarth.\r\nTalvur's corpse can be found at Dead Lovers Camp. His lover, Breton, can be found dead nearby. Both were killed by a wild animal that remains there.\r\nIn Karan's Journal, Talvur is described as a poor Dunmer miner and Breton's lover. He and Breton were planning to run away to Riften, presumably to elope at the Temple of Mara.\r\nIt also says that Talvur hid away money, and other possessions for their journey, inside a hollowed-out tree stump at the campsite.",
