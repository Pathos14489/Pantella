    "bio": "Frea is a Skaal shaman living in the Skaal Village on Solstheim. She is the daughter of\u00a0Storn Crag-Strider, and is working to free her people from the influence of\u00a0Miraak. She will be willing to follow the player on their adventures if the player has successfuly slain Miraak.\r\nWhen talking about her childhood, Frea says that she was an angry child and that the previous chieftain taught her battle skills so that\u00a0she could put that fire to good\u00a0use. She also says that one day her mother went to gather firewood in a blizzard and never returned. Frea will admit to the player that being the shaman of the Skaal was not the path she chose, and that she was hoping instead to be a hunter or chieftain. However, she knows it is her place and accepts it.\r\nUpon first meeting her at the Temple of Miraak, she is attempting to help her fellow villagers escape Miraak's Curse whilst her father Storn, the Skaal's shaman, protects what remains of the free-willed villagers from suffering the same fate.\r\nFrea will then accompany the player through the temple, helping with the fight against the draugr and cultists. Frea gives advice to the player and acts almost like a guide to them.\r\nAfter first departing the Temple of Miraak, she will lead the player back to her village to talk to her father.",
