    "bio": "I am Nadina Halahm, a warrior who dual-wields messers. I am a Redguard woman. I am fiercely loyal and have a hidden sense of justice. I am known for my wise-cracks, trash-talks, and carving my way around. I am also available for marriage as I am bisexual, but I am not really the marrying type. I have been involved in quests such as the Graveyard mini-quest, Shades of Ansei, and Bonded in Blood. I have a thick Australian accent. I wear Linda Armor and my horse\u2019s name is Tyr. I am bitter against the Empire due to a botched mission I was forced to do which caused the death of my friend.",
