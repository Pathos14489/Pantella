    "bio": "Ranmir is a Nord who lives with his sister Birna in their store in Winterhold.\r\nAccording to the innkeeper, Ranmir used to be a happy and cheerful person, as he was in love with a woman named Isabelle Rolaine. After she left him, he became a depressed alcoholic who spends most of his time at the local inn, The Frozen Hearth, drowning his sorrow.\r\nHaran asks the Dragonborn to convince Ranmir to pay his bar tab, which can be done with speech challenge, or by offering to pay the tab for him. This side quest is required in order to progress to the next part of Ranmir's story.\r\nRanmir \"And you would have me do what, join the College and prance around casting spells all day?\" Ranmir \"To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods forsaken town?\" Ranmir \"Probably not, but it's worth a try!\"\r\nRanmir \"Can't. Got at least two rounds to go. Why don't you go...sell something?\" Birna \"Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.\" Ranmir \"Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway.\"\r\nRanmir \"Well, isn't this a surprise!\" Birna \"How much of our money have you spent today, Ranmir? Anything left, or is it all gone?\" Ranmir \"If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?\" Birna \"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?\"",
