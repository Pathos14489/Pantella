    "bio": "Tatriana lives in Riften, where she works as a barmaid at the Ragged Flagon. The Flagon is located in a cistern in the Ratway, Riften's old sewer network. The bar is strongly associated with the Thieves Guild, whose members often patronize the bar. The Thieves Guild's main hideout is nearby in the Ratway.\r\nThe Flagon is run by Vekel, who some call \"Vekel the Man\". Vekel's girlfriend is a Redguard woman named Tonilia, who serves as a fence for stolen goods and usually hangs around the Flagon. A man named Dirge works at the Flagon as the bouncer. A woman named Vex and a Breton man named Delvin are two of the Thieves Guild's most important members, and they can usually be found in the Flagon. A mysterious female Bosmer in hooded robes usually sits in the back of the bar.\r\nTatriana is a tall Nord woman with long blonde hair and blue-gray eyes. She has a blind and scarred left eye. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. She has a coworker barmaid named Ridene. When working, Tatriana walks around the bar serving drinks and food.",
