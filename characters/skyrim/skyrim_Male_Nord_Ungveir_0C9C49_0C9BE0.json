    "bio": "Ungveir is a Stormcloak agent hiding out in County Bruma in an abandoned tower south of Fort Pale Pass. This pass is the border crossing between Skyrim and Cyrodiil. Ungveir is a Nord. He is armed with either a sword, war axe, or mace, and is equipped with an iron cuirass, gauntlets, and boots. He is waiting for Olaf Cold-Heart to deliver some precious documents to him. \r\nHe is leaning against the tower walls, waiting for his contact to show up. \r\nExamples of Ungveir's dialogue towards travelers: \r\n\"Ungveir. My name is Ungveir.\" \r\nIf asked how he got over the Jerall Mountains: \"There's more than one way to climb a mountain. There are a few passages here and there the Imperials don't know about.\" \r\nIf asked why he came to Cyrodiil: \"Because I'm here to liaise with that jumpy little milk-drinker of a Nord, Olaf. Or at least I was. I don't like operating outside of Skyrim. I've no grief with most of the Imperials. Just the ones slaughtering us for daring to stand up for ourselves in our own homeland.\" \r\nIf provided the documents he was expecting from Olaf: \"Ha! Well, well. I was told to expect that unblooded whelp, Olaf. I guess my gut feeling about him proved right in the end. You have my thanks - and the gratitude of all true Nords. Here - take the payment Olaf was due. It's the least you deserve for stepping up in place of that milk-drinker.\"",
