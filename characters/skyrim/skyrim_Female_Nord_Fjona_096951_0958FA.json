    "bio": "Fjona is a former member of the Companions who now travels around Skyrim as a hunter and a bard. She is a young Nord woman with blue eyes and long auburn hair.\r\nDespite fighting with her bow from long range when combat arises, she wears heavy armor (her set of Wolf armor from when she was a member of the Companions) due to her childhood trauma. Having been unable to defend herself for much of her life, her main goal is to become stronger, and she has slowly been shedding the various \"crutches\" on which she has previously depended. One such crutch that she has already shed is her familiar: a spirit she summoned as a child when her village was attacked at night by Falmer.\r\nSeven years ago, Fjona fulfilled her childhood dream and joined the Companions, a group of warriors who take on contracts for the people of Skyrim. However, life as a Companion wasn't quite what she hoped it would be. The Companions have a inner group called the Circle, and all its members (including Kodlak Whitemane, the Harbinger/leader of the Companions) are secretly werewolves. Unwilling to become a werewolf, Fjona left the Companions. When referring to the Companions, Fjona sometimes calls them \"the Wolves\".\r\nWhen performing as a bard in taverns (such as the Bee and Barb in Riften), Fjona plays her lute and sings in a soothing melodic voice. The following are some of songs Fjona will play if requested: Wolves of Jorrvaskr, A Warrior's Life, Mogo's Mead, Eyldi the Bear, and Tears of the Hist.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Ah, greetings fellow traveler.\"\r\n\"I sometimes fashion myself a bard, or a sword-singer of legend.\"\r\nIf asked why she left the Companions: \"You see, to be a Companion, to be part of the Circle, one must give up a piece of their humanity. It was not something I was willing to give. I've always been suspicious of easy power. The only strength you can truly rely on is the kind that's earned. So I left my shield-brothers and sisters and set out on my own.\"\r\nIf asked if she might rejoin the Companions: \"No, and it has nothing to do with the Circle. That's why I left, but there's a different reason why I won't return. When I was a child I thought of nothing else but joining the fabled Companions. Not out of some desire to be a hero, but because I believed there was no safer place to live than inside the great mead hall of Jorrvaskr. I remember kneeling on the steps, drenched in wet rags, the clouds practically screaming the rain. but scorn. 'Who do you think we are, girl, Jorrvaskr is not an orphanage' he said. And he was right. All my life I'd sought the protection of others, when I should have been learning to protect myself.\"\r\n\"I never developed any real magical talent. Didn't learn the finer points of spellcasting. My only trick was to summon that familiar. All I had to do, all I had to be, was scared. Throughout my youth I was plagued by nightmares, and I would conjure the spirit out of reflex. And when I had him near me, saw the way his body lit the darkness, I felt safe. But then I grew up.  Enough time passes, and you forget the things that frightened you in the first place.\"\r\nIf asked how she joined the Companions: \"My chance came about 7 summers ago, when the city held a tournament to celebrate the birth of the Jarl's son. I was a girl not even flowered, and the crowd behind me laughed and jeered when I requested to enter my name in the archers' list. But all went silent when Eorlund Gray-Mane vouched for me, and paid for my entrance with a dagger from the Sky-Forge. From his view atop the Sky-Forge, he'd seen me grow from a child who could barely nock an arrow to one who could bulls-eye a flea. He watched me train outside Jorrvaskr day and night, in the chills of winter and the rains of spring, so that I could one day earn my way inside. And on that day there was not an archer in Whiterun whose aim was more true. Not Athis or Irileth, not even Aela the Huntress would best me. I was fortunate. Aela's a more skillful archer than I, but on that day she was not at her best, and I was never better.\"\r\nIf asked if she is an adventurer: \"Hardly. In my time with the Wolves, I did a lot of small favors. Pest control, muscle jobs, or hunting down petty thieves. As someone who's spent half her life in the slums, and the other half tracking and hunting forest game, this work was easy. Unfortunately, raiding caves, Draugr crypts, ghost ships and spider dens are another matter entirely. You might spend a week in some crypt, and have no treasure to show for it. So you also have to learn to handle disappointment. Yet it's not the size of a cave that worries me, but what lives inside it. Particularly, the caves marked by the Falmer.\"\r\n\"I grew up in a poor village outside of Whiterun. It was very small, but full of children, and as such, full of life. They said when we played in the yard, the peals of laughter rang all the way to Dragonsreach. Yet when I think about that village, I can never hear it. I listen for it, train my ears toward the darkness, but what comes out isn't laughter. There were screams that night. So many screams. The Falmer took my mother. They took my father. They tried to take me. Before she tucked me in, my mother used to light a single sconce by my bed, to ward off the dark. I remember the way that light wrapped around its face. How it stood there, tracing its mouth with its tongue... I...I'm sorry. No more talk about the Falmer. They're foul creatures, and if I never see another it will be too soon.\"",
