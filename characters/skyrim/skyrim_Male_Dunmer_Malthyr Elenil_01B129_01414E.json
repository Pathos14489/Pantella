Elenil will hire thugs to pursue the Dragonborn for stealing from the Cornerclub in Windhelm (stealing the double-distilled skoomabottle\u00a0for Stands-In-Shallows).\r\nMalthyr: \"You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you.\" Brunwulf: \"It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls 'outsiders'.\" Malthyr: \"You've seen how we live in cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name 'Gray Quarter' is an insult.\" Brunwulf: \"I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind.\" Malthyr: \"That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you.\"",
