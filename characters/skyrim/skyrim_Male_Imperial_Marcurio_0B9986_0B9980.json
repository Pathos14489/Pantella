    "bio": "Marcurio is an Imperial spellcaster in Skyrim who resides in the Bee and Barb in Riften. He can be hired as a follower for 500 gold. After hiring him, and wearing an Amulet of Mara, Marcurio becomes a candidate for marriage.\r\nMarcurio is a mage who is feisty and sassy, saying things such as \"Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.\" \r\nHe is very interested in Dwemer culture and technology, though he admits he would like them more were they not constantly trying to kill him. When in ancient Nordic tombs, he reflects on his seemingly extensive knowledge of Nordic culture and history.\r\nMarcurio specializes in Destruction spells. He also prefers to use his default robes, refusing to equip any other type of robe given to him, though he equips any armor given to him. Like many other followers, he has a hunting bow with 12 iron arrows, which he will use when out of magicka. He will equip any weapon, as long as it is stronger than his dagger. However, he prefers to use spells over weapons, which he will use only rarely.\r\nHis favored spells are shock-based, and will use fire as a back-up, though he often has a shock spell in one hand and firebolt in the other. When fighting undead (such as draugr), he utilizes the Turn Undead spell. In addition, Marcurio can use any staves placed in his inventory.\r\nIf the Dragonborn has a homestead, Marcurio may be hired as a steward for it, and if the Dragonborn has children, he is one of the few male spouses who have a dialog option in which the Dragonborn may ask how the children are.",
