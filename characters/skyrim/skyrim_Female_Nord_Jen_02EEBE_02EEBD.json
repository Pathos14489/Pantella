    "bio": "Jen lives in the small town of Heljarchen. She is a farmer.\r\nHeljarchen is a small town next to a small lake, located within the Pale hold of Skyrim. Rocky hills and pine trees surround this town and lake, except on the north side. The much larger Lake Yogrim to the southeast, which is frozen over for much of the year, is fairly close to Heljarchen. There is a major road (which runs east-west) just north of the town, and people traveling along this road often stay the night in Heljarchen at Nightgate Inn. North of this road, the tall and wide Winterhold mountain range looms over the town and the surrounding areas.\r\nJen is a Nord woman with long dark hair. Her house is between the house of Heigen (a male farmer) and the rocky hills west of the town. On a night, Jen can often be found having a drink at Nightgate Inn, which is managed by an older man named Hadring.",
