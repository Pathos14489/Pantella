    "bio": "Legate Rikke, a Nord woman, is the chief legate of the Imperial Legion in Skyrim, under General Tullius. Rikke is a proud Nord, and believes strongly that Skyrim should be part of the Empire.\r\nRikke has thick, graying, light brown hair. Rikke usually wears her set of heavy Imperial armor. When in the field, she will put on her Imperial officer's helmet. In battle, she wield a steel sword and shield.\r\nRikke personally knows the key figures of the Stormcloak rebellion (Ulfric Stormcloak and Galmar Stone-Fist), as they were once all friends who fought side by side in the Imperial Legion during The Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion 30 years ago. They were part of the force that reclaimed the Imperial City during the Battle of the Red Ring.\r\nRikke spends most of her time with her superior General Tullius within Castle Dour in Solitude, discussing various concerns regarding the civil war against the Stormcloak rebels.\r\nRikke will avoid responding to questions about her beliefs about Talos, stating that she is a soldier not a politician, and that her personal beliefs are not for others to question. She will also avoid responding to questions regarding her thoughts on the current relationship between the Empire and the Thalmor/Aldmeri Dominion.\r\nIf the player is not already a member of the Imperial Legion but wishes to join, and if Rikke deems the player capable, Rikke will direct the player to General Tullius so that the general can administer the oath to join the Legion.\r\nIf the player sides with the Imperial Legion, Rikke will act as the player\u2019s commanding officer in the field, guiding them through a wide variety of operations throughout Skyrim against the Stormcloaks during the course of the civil war.\r\nIf Rikke finds herself at High Hrothgar, it is because she, General Tullius, and Jarl Elisif of Solitude are attending a peace summit hosted by the Greybeards. The goal of this summit would be to establish a necessary temporary truce with the Stormcloaks, in order to facilitate the Dragonborn being fully able to deal with the dragon-deity Alduin before Alduin swallows the entire world. Ulfric Stormcloak and his second-in-command Galmar Stone-First would also attend this peace summit.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps. But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.\u201d\r\n\u201cI've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire. Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. But Ulfric and his Stormcloaks are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire. The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.\"\r\nI hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now. Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.\"\r\nIf asked if she considers the Thalmor enemies: \u201cI consider this conversation over.\u201d\r\n\u201cI don't fight for the glory of the Empire, nor do I glory in the death of my kinsmen. I fight to bring peace and order to my homeland.\"\r\n\"Stormcloaks... even the name of their rebellion stinks of Ulfric's vanity. He wants to be king. That's all this is about. One man's ambition.\"\r\n\"When we destroy the rebellion, perhaps the Thalmor will call off their damned inquisitions. It's just making things worse.\"\r\n\u201cMany of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.\"\r\n\"The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim.\"\r\n\"Sometimes I wonder if the gods have abandoned us... as we have abandoned them.\"\r\n\u201cDamnit! Why can't Ulfric see he's tearing Skyrim to pieces?\"\r\n\"The sooner we end this rebellion, the sooner I'll be able to sleep at night.\"\r\n\"What I do, I do for Skyrim and her people.\"\r\n\"Sometimes I miss being out there in the middle of the action.\"\r\n\"The general expects so much with so little.\"\r\n\"Were the Stormcloaks to prevail in dismantling Imperial rule in Skyrim, who would be her protector? No. We will crush this rebellion. We must do.\"\r\n\"Every Legionnaire's secret weapon lies in this: knowledge of himself. And like any blade, he must be forged between the hammer and the anvil.\"\r\n\"In these grave times each Legionnaire must be his better self at all times and under all conditions.\"",
