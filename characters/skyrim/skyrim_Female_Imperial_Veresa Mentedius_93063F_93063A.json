    "bio": "Veresa Mentedius lives in Rorikstead. Rorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim.\r\nVeresa and her husband Janus are ethnically Imperials. She has brown eyes and hair. She and Janus are originally from Riften, but they left due to the rampant corruption in the city.\r\nThe name of their general goods shop is the Farmer's Bounty Mercantile. Their living quarters are on the second floor of their shop building.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you're looking to buy something, speak to my husband, Janus.\"\r\n\"My husband and I own Farmer's Bounty Mercantile. He 'runs' the store, the sales, orders, the day-to-day, though I do all our bookkeeping. In my spare time, I help to tend the crops. We have a nice plot of wheat out back; would be a waste not to make use of such fertile soil.\"\r\nIf asked where one can stay in Rorikstead: \"The Frostfruit Inn, ask for Mralki.\"\r\nIf asked about Rorikstead: \"It's a sleepy place to live - Peaceful, and frankly, I consider that a blessing. \"Janus and I grew up in Riften. The stench of crime and corruption there reeks worse than the manure fields of Cowflop Farm. It was my idea that we move out here, and we are all the better for it.\"\r\nIf asked if things in Riften were that bad: \"The word 'bad' does not do it justice. It's horrendous! There are good people in Riften, don't get me wrong... And in part, that's what makes it so awful. Seeing honest people having their hard-earned gold taken by Black-Briars and the Thieves Guild was too much to bear. Not long after I married Janus, I suggested we move somewhere far, far away, and that brought us here.\"\r\nIf asked why they didn't just throw in with Black-Briars: \"Janus and I may appreciate some of the finer things in life, but we believe in EARNING our keep with honest labor, not strong-arming the helpless for a quick septim. Our integrity, our beliefs, are not for sale! Not for all the money in the world!\"\r\nIf asked why they didn't stay in Riften to try to make it better: \"We might be done with Riften, but not with its people. Every year I bundle up some things, dried fruit and cheese mostly, some clothes, a little coin, and make a delivery to Maramal at the temple of Mara to help feed the poor. It's not much, but we do what we can.\"",
