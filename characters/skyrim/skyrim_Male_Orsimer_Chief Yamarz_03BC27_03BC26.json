    "bio": "Yamarz is the chief of the Orc stronghold of Largashbur. Largashbur is located in the southern part of the The Rift, near the ancient Dwarven ruin of Avanchnzel, at the base of the Jerall Mountains\r\nYamarz is clad in a complete set of Orcish equipment. This includes the cuirass, a pair of gauntlets, a pair of boots, and a helmet. He is equipped with an Orcish war axe and an Orcish shield.\r\nLike many Orcs who live in Orc strongholds, Chief Yamarz dislikes outsiders. He is generally unpleasant and displays many traits not normally associated with Orcs, such as a conniving nature and an aversion to battle. Yamarz is considerably weak and nervous when it comes to fighting.\r\nYamarz does not bother maintaining the shrine to Malacath located in Fallowstone Cave, to the east of Riften.\r\nFor the past couple months, Largashbur has been continuously attacked by giants, who have so far killed several members of the stronghold. The Orcs of Largashbur are convinced that they are being cursed and punished by Malacath, the Daedric Prince whom they worship. While many in the stronghold (such Atub, a sorceress) have been discussing the possibility of enlisting the help of an outsider to help lift this curse, Yamarz does not like this idea. Yamarz will usually not be very willing to engage in conversation with the player.\r\nThe Forgemaster's Fingers are a pair of enchanted heavy armor gauntlets that were once worn by a legendary Orc blacksmith. If the player is a non-Orc who has found The Forgemaster's Fingers and gives this artifact to any Orc stronghold, its Chief will reward and honor the player by bestowing them with the title of \u201cBlood-kin of the Orcs\u201d, granting them full access to the stronghold. Other Orc strongholds across Skyrim will also be notified of the player\u2019s new Blood-kin status, and will grant the player the same level of respect and access to their strongholds. There are also alternative methods by which the player can achieve Blood-Kin status, such a slaying a dragon within view of an Orc stronghold, or performing a difficult task for a respected Orc. If the player is an Orc, they will already automatically be welcome within all Orc strongholds, and will not need to prove themselves to attain Blood-kin status.\r\nThere may come a time where Yamarz and the player journey together to Fallowstone Cave, in order to kill the giants there who have overrun the shrine to Malacath which is located within the cave. If this happens, Yamarz may ask the player to fight the giants for him, offering them large sums of gold and requesting that the player not reveal this arrangement to the rest of the members of the Largashbur stronghold, since the Orcs would consider this arrangement to be very dishonorable. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Curses aren't enough, now I must suffer you too?
