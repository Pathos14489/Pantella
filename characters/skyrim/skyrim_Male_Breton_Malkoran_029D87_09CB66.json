    "bio": "Malkoran is a Breton conjurer in the Kilkreath Ruins. He stole Dawnbreaker from Meridia and used its power to create an army of corrupted shades. He is the primary antagonist of the quest \"The Break of Dawn.\"\r\nEnemy of the Daedric Lord Meridia, Malkoran is one of the most powerful wizards in Skyrim, and his combination of Destruction and Restoration spells are amongst the toughest for the Dragonborn to go up against. He will arm himself with a Steadfast Ward nearly every time they use a Destruction spell of their own or a shout, plus a Fast Healing spell should his health be lowered.\r\nAlso, Malkoran will unleash a pair of frost-related Destruction spells, Icy Spear and Ice Storm. Once he is killed, his shade will emerge from his recently killed corpse and will unleash powerful attacks.\r\nUpon obtaining the beacon, which is a large gem with no value, Meridia commands the Dragonborn to take the beacon to the shrine located west of Solitude, directly north of the Haafingar Stormcloak Camp. Once there, Meridia will tell the Dragonborn that there is a powerful necromancer named Malkoran defiling her temple, whom the Dragonborn must destroy.",
