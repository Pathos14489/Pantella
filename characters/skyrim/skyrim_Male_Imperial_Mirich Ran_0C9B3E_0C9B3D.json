    "bio": "Mirich Ran buys and sells contraband, and smuggles goods (including people) between Skyrim and Cyrodiil, near the Pale Pass at the border. Ethnically, he is an Imperial. He is currently camped on the Skyrim side of the border. Legate Centos Durius and his Imperial Legion troops guard the gate at this mountain pass and let almost no one through. For a fee of 200 gold, Mirich will show travelers a nearby alternative route into Cyrodiil, called the Serpent's Trail. He is careful not to allow the Legion troops to catch wind of his activities.\r\nHe sells an assortment of quality weapons (including arrows), ingots, ores, gems, jewelry (including enchanted jewelry), potions (such as Cure Disease), poisons, soul gems, spell tomes, and lockpicks. He will also buy such items from others at much cheaper rates, for eventual resale.\r\nExamples of Mirich's dialogue towards travelers:\r\n\"Ah, a traveler, a traveler! Delightful, delightful! Ran's the name, rare and valuable goods and services is my game! Might I interest you in some of my marvelous goods? Or perhaps you're here for my... special services?\"\r\n\"Fine hides, hunting supplies, and... special merchandise.\"",
