    "bio": "Ria is the newest member of The Companions until the player joins. She is also the only Imperial currently in the ranks. She resides in Whiterun, and can be found within or just behind Jorrvaskr.\r\nRia states she has dreamed of being a Companion since she was a little girl, and is very enthusiastic about her membership. She is determined to fight and die alongside her Shield-Siblings.\r\nRia can also be encountered randomly in the wilds of Skyrim, traveling with Vilkas.\r\nIf the player becomes Harbinger of the Companions, they can recruit Ria as a follower. Ria then also becomes a candidate for marriage. After marrying, she may leave the house in order to complete jobs, but she returns in a day or two.\r\nRia's default weapon is a Skyforge Steel Sword. She will naturally dual wield any two weapons given to her.",
