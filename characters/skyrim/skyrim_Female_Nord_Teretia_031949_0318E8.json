    "bio": "Teretia, a Nord woman, lives in Dragon Bridge. She works as a barmaid at the Four Shields Tavern. She is employed by the owner of this tavern/inn: a woman named Faida. A local teenage Breton girl named Julienne Lylvieve is Faida's apprentice, training to be an innkeeper like her. A Redguard woman named Arisse also works as a barmaid there, who additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.\r\nTeretia has blue-gray eyes and light blondish-brown hair. She has some facial scarring: three claw marks across her left cheek and lips. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Teretia walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
