    "bio": "Fjori, a Nord woman, was a huntress long ago in the forests of Skyrim.\r\nAt age 29, she met Holgeir, a warlord. The two battled, falling in love when Fjori broke his axe with her sword, and he dulled her sword with his shield. Shortly after, Holgeir was bitten by a venomous snake.\r\nFjori obtained an elixir from the Akaviri and saved Holgeir's life. Her love fully-restored, she too was bitten by the same snake after the elixir was used up, falling dead. Holgeir built a tomb for her, killing himself after its completion.\r\nFjori appears as a draugr, summoned by Lu'ah Al-Skaven, a Redguard woman necromancer in Ansilvund. She wields either an Ancient Nord or ebony weapon, especially if she spawns as a Draugr Death Overlord or Draugr Deathlord. After Lu'ah is defeated, Fjori appears alongside Holgeir as a ghost, and reward the player with the Ghostblade before disappearing.",
