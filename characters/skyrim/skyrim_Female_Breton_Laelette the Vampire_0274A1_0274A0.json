    "bio": "Laelette, a Breton woman, is a vampire residing in Morthal. She is the wife of Thonnir, and mother of Virkmund, and a servant of Alva.\r\nAlva, a vampire, fed from Laelette when she came to visit her. Alva decided to keep Laelette, alive to use as a personal servant. Suspicious of Laelette's disappearance, Thonnir, her husband, went to Alva for an explanation, since Laelette was last seen visiting Alva. Alva told Thonnir she left Morthal to join the Stormcloaks.\r\nWhen Alva charmed Hroggar and wanted to enthrall him and keep him as a guardian of her coffin, she ordered Laelette to murder his family and make it look like an accident. Instead, Laelette burned their home to the ground, with the family still inside. During the burning, she became enamored with Helgi, Hroggar's daughter, and gave her vampiric blood, although she did not survive the fire.\r\nLaelette has become obsessed with Helgi, visiting her coffin nightly at the Morthal Cemetery to try to raise her back from the dead.\r\n",
