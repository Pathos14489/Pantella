    "bio": "Barknar, a Nord man, is a pilgrim who can often be found examining the etched tablets along the 7000 Steps on the path to High Hrothgar, or at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead. He wears hide armor, gloves, and has reddish-brown hair.\r\nBarknar has been spending most of his time on the path to High Hrothgar, walking the steps and meditating on the emblems. He likes to hunt, and carries a bow and a multitude of arrows with him.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way.\"",
