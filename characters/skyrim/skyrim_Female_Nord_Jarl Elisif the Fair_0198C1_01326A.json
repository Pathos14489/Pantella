    "bio": "Elisif is the Jarl of Solitude and the widow of High King Torygg. Torygg was the last elected High King of Skyrim, prior to the Stormcloak Rebellion.\r\nElisif is a young Nord woman. She has blue eyes and long auburn hair. She is sometimes called \"Elisif the Fair\" due to her light complexion and natural beauty. She wears raiment fit for royalty, including a circlet adorned with rubies.\r\nElisif is head of court at the Blue Palace in Solitude. Solitude is the Hold capital of Haafingar, as well as the provincial capital of Skyrim as a whole. The majority of Elisif's courtly duties are handled by her steward, Falk Firebeard. Bolgeir Bearclaw loyally serves as her personal housecarl, while a valorous woman named Bryling and a cunning businessman named Erikur serve as court thanes. An enigmatic Breton woman named Sybille Stentor serves as her court wizard.\r\nCastle Dour, near the other end of the city from the palace, serves as the headquarters of the Imperial Legion in Skyrim. \r\nAfter Ulfric Stormcloak used the Voice to murder her husband Torygg, Elisif became the Jarl of Solitude and Haafingar Hold. Following her ascension to power in Solitude, Elisif has worked in close cooperation with the Empire, against Ulfric Stormcloak and his rebellion. The Empire's support, along with Elisif's marriage to the last High King, makes Elisif the most likely candidate for monarch of Skyrim if General Tullius and the Imperial Legion succeed in defeating the Stormcloaks.\r\nElisif's lack of experience and her dependence on Imperial support make her worried that if she does become High Queen of Skyrim, she will be largely beholden to the Empire's influence. However, Elisif is still an outspoken supporter of the Empire, and her goal is to keep Skyrim as one of its provinces, as it has been since the Empire's inception. She views the Stormcloak Rebellion as a blight upon Skyrim. She is not willing to express any of her personal worries about Imperial influence over Solitude and Skyrim, out of fear that her expressing such worries will provide fuel to the Stormcloak narrative and cause.\r\nElisif is sensitive to the death of her husband and is still mourning his loss. His death overshadows much of what she does. Elisif is young and inexperienced, relying on Falk Firebeard to see to many of her duties. She is very receptive to the advice of her court, commonly asking her thanes for their opinion and usually listening to them. Elisif has little confidence in her abilities, and is very impressionable. Due to her mourning of her husband, lack of confidence, and inexperience with ruling, some in Solitude see Elisif as an ineffective ruler. Despite all this, she does retain some respect, such as from General Tullius and Falk Firebeard. Falk has been teaching Elisif the ways of statecraft and politics.\r\nThough Elisif does not worship Talos, her husband did. Elisif may ask someone she trusts to deliver Torygg's old war horn to a shrine of Talos, so that her husband can have the funerary rites he would have wanted.\r\nThere is room for another thane in Solitude's court, but before Elisif can provide anyone with this title, this person must be recognized as having significantly contributed to the wellbeing of Haafingar Hold, and must also own property in the city.\r\nElisif recently ordered the cancellation of an annual local festival hosted by the Bards College, known as The Burning of King Olaf. The reason for this cancellation is that this festival involves the burning of an effigy of a king; this may be considered to be in poor taste, given the late King Torygg's recent murder. However, Elisif is open to being persuaded to rescind her ban of this festival. Elisif is on generally good terms with Viarmo, a male Altmer who serves as the headmaster of the Bards College.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks win the Civil War by capturing Solitude, Elisif will be forced to swear fealty to Ulfric Stormcloak. If the player decides to side with the Stormcloaks, Elisif will hold no anger against them personally, but will lament their choice.\r\nElisif sometimes attends parties at the Thalmor Embassy west of Solitude, hosted by Thalmor Ambassador Elenwen.\r\nElisif is looking forward to attending the upcoming wedding of Vittoria Vici (the Emperor's cousin) and Asgeir Snow-Shod (a wealthy merchant from Riften) at the Temple of the Divines in Solitude. It will be a marriage of both love and political advantage; a rare thing indeed. This wedding's reception will be open to the public of Solitude.\r\nExamples of Elisif's dialogue:\r\n\"With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my steward.\"\r\n\"Ulfric is a fool and a coward who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare! It's rather sad, really.\"\r\n\"Thanks to Ulfric's rebellion, countless innocent people can't feed or clothe their families. It's unacceptably tragic.\"\r\n\"May the blessings of the Eight be with you.\"\r\n\"Be well. Pray for Solitude, and my husband.\"\r\n\"Keep the faith. General Tullius will win this war.\"\r\nIf met at the Thalmor Embassy: \"I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for the jarls and business leaders of Skyrim. Elenwen must be very fond of you. Her parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste. My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often. Have you tried the wine? It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.\"\r\nIf asked why Ulfric killed her husband: \"Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power. Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg. And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare. When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be. That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it.\"\r\nIf asked if she trusts General Tullius: \"Hmmm... A question I am all too familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often. They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people. The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him. Trust is always difficult, especially for my people. Yet we must trust Tullius' leadership. For what other choice do we have?\"\r\nIf asked if she is the High Queen of Skyrim: \"Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title. This land is driven by war, and its people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged. Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.\"",
