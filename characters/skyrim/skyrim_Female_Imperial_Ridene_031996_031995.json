The bar is strongly associated with the Thieves Guild, whose members often patronize the bar. The Thieves Guild's main hideout is nearby in the Ratway.\r\nThe Flagon is run by Vekel, who some call \"Vekel the Man\".

A woman named Vex and a Breton man named Delvin are two of the Thieves Guild's most important members, and they can usually be found in the Flagon.
