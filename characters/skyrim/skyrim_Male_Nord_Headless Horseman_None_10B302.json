    "bio": "The Headless Horseman is the headless specter of a warrior who can be seen riding around Skyrim on his ghostly steed at night, or staying at Hamvir's Rest during the day, facing its cemetery. He wields an iron or steel battleaxe and wears steel plate armor.\r\nHe will spawn randomly anywhere in the world between 10 PM and 4 AM. He will occasionally stop and let himself be examined and then continue riding. If one looks closely, it seems he is wearing steel plate armor, gauntlets, and boots. The Horseman performs no actions, and cannot be harmed. The Headless Horseman is also not connected to any quests.\r\nIf he is followed, he will normally go to Hamvir's Rest. There will be three skeletons and one leveled draugr to fight, as well as a master-level chest, some random items, and nightshade to collect. If Hamvir's Rest is fast-traveled to during the daytime, the Headless Horseman can be seen there. He will stand at the entrance of the cemetery and will not move until the Dragonborn is out of his sight.",

It's a Skyrim-ified version of the MaleAltmer_Bosmer_Dunmer_GSaint voice model from Oblivion. It's not a perfect match, but it's the same VA: Craig Sechler"
