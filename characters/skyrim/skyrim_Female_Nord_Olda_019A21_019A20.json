    "bio": "Olda lives in Dragon Bridge. She is married to Horgeir.\r\nOlda is a Nord woman with long dark hair and gray-hazel eyes. She usually wears standard farm clothing or a belted tunic. She sometimes wears a hat or a headscarf.\r\nOlda often complains about her husband and the debt he incurs with his drinking problem.\r\n Horgeir sometimes even embarrasses himself by leaving the local tavern without paying for his drinks. This tavern is called the Four Shields Tavern, and is run by a woman named Faida.\r\nHorgeir recently swore on his ancestors that he'd give up the drinking, but Olda has discovered that he has a secret stash of drinks in a nearby cave, which is guarded by some wolves. Olda may ask the player to retrieve the bottles of Dragon's Breath Mead from this stash and bring them to her. If this favor is performed, she will consider them as her friend.\r\nThe town of Dragon Bridge is located in Haafingar, southwest of the city of Solitude. Solitude is the provincial capital of Skyrim. To the southeast of Dragon Bridge there is a long stone bridge that spans the chasm overlooking the Karth River, which marks the boundary between Haafingar and Hjaalmarch holds. The town is named after this bridge.\r\nHorgeir and Olda own the lumber mill near the bridge. Horgeir and his brother Lodvar work at the mill.\r\nOlda is vocally opposed to the increased Imperial Legion military presence in Dragon Bridge, fearing that they will confiscate the mill in the name of their war effort.\r\nOlda has been cheating on her husband with Lodvar, her husband's brother. She and Lodvar sometimes have a picnic up the mountain, where they drink wine and sleep with each other. Horgeir seems to be the only one in Dragon Bridge who doesn't know about Olda and Lodvar's affair.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested.\"\r\n\"Have you met my husband? Well don't bother, he's a drunk.\"\r\n\"Where is that lazy man?\"\r\n\"Did my worthless husband send you?\"\r\n\"Got nothing to say to strange folk.\"\r\n\"I'm sure it's only a matter of time until the guards seize our mill in the name of their war effort. Next thing you know, there'll be more guards, and then we'll lose our homes as well. This is just the start of it, mark my words.\"\r\n\"My husband owns the lumber mill, barely. He'll lose it soon enough. He's behind on his loan payments, but he drinks all his money away just the same. Now we're deep in debt, penniless and about to lose our sole source of income.\"\r\n\"I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it.\"\r\nIf someone retrieves the mead from Horgeir's stash and gives it to Olda: \"Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it. Here, some gold for your trouble.\"",
