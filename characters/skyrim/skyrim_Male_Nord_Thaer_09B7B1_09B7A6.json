He waits there until someone needs a ride to any of the hold capitals of Skyrim.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about Solitude: \"Solitude has been the capital of Skyrim for as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first. Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company.
