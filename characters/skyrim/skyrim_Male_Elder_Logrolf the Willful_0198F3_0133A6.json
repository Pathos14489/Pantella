    "bio": "Logrolf the Willful is an elder priest of the Daedric Prince Boethiah. He has desecrated a Shrine of Molag Bal by using it in Boethiah's name instead. The Daedric Prince of Domination and Enslavement would like nothing more than to have Logrolf kneel one final time at his shrine to enact sweet revenge.\r\nHowever, Logrolf has gone missing and Molag Bal must call upon a worthy ally to rescue poor Logrolf, so as not to miss his chance.\r\nThe Dragonborn will first rescue him from a random forsworn camp for Molag Bal. The Daedric Prince will first instruct the Dragonborn to beat Logrolf into submission with the rusty mace.\r\nThis cannot be accomplished on the first try, and Logrolf will die. However, Molag Bal will resurrect Logrolf and he will submit on the second try. After this, Molag Bal will instruct the Dragonborn to kill him, and his orders must be carried out.",
