    "bio": "Rina lives in Solitude, the provincial capital city of Skyrim. She works as one of the barmaids at the Winking Skeever, a popular inn/tavern. Rina's boss is an Imperial man named Corpulus Vinius, who owns the inn. Corpulus is assisted in running the inn by his children: his young adult son Sorex and capable younger daughter Minette. Kirginne (a Nord), Miraette (an Imperial), and Suleen (an Altmer) are Rina's barmaid co-workers at the tavern. Bards from Solitude's Bards College (such as a cheerful woman named Lisette) often play music at the tavern.\r\nRina is a Breton woman with long dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and large breasts. Like many Breton women, she is quite short. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, Rina helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.",
