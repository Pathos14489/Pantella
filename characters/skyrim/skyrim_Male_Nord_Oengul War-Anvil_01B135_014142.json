    "bio": "Oengul War-Anvil is a Nord blacksmith living in the Blacksmith Quarters of Windhelm.\r\nHe is eager to prove that he is a better blacksmith than\u00a0Eorlund Gray-Mane\u00a0of\u00a0Whiterun. Many speculate that he became a smith to profit from the Civil War, however, he dismisses these claims.\r\nOengul asks the Dragonborn to retrieve Queen Freydis's Sword, a blade fabled for its superior edge, from a random location. Returning with the blade, Oengul increases the Dragonborn's Smithing skill by one. His dialogue or the quest reward will not change even if the Dragonborn's smithing skill is 100 already, meaning that doing that this quest at 100 smithing will yield no reward. Giving Oengul the sword will allow the player to take the three steel ingot and four iron ingot from between grindstone and workbench, for free.\r\nOengul: \"No, I want to take my time with it.\" Oengul: \"This is more delicate work than you're used to.\" Oengul: \"This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years.\"",
