    "bio": "Linwe is an Altmer and leader of a rival guild to the Thieves Guild, called the Summerset Shadows.\r\nThe Dragonborn is informed that Linwe takes an interest in stealing from the dead. He apparently does not kill his marks; rather, he raids Halls of the Dead and steals from corpses.\r\nHe wears a set of armor that is similar in appearance to that of Vipir, Tonilia, Thrynn, and Sapphire's armor. Unlike the rest of the Summerset Shadows, who are wearing armor alike to the Thieves Guild Armor, his armor may be looted. The armor is a unique set, as it is labeled with his name. It is almost identical to the Blackguard's Armor.\r\nLinwe must be killed and Fjotli's Silver Locket must be retrieved from his corpse.",
