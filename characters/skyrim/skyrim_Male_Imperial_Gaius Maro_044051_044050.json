    "bio": "Gaius Maro is an agent of the Penitus Oculatus, and is currently stationed in Skyrim. The Penitus Oculatus is an organization under the direct command of Emperor Titus Mede the Second, and serves as the Emperor's personal agents and bodyguards. Skyrim's Penitus Oculatus division is headquartered in the town of Dragon Bridge, near Skyrim's provincial capital city of Solitude. Commander Maro is the leader of Skyrim's Penitus Oculatus division, and is the father of Gaius. Gaius and his father are on good terms.\r\nIn anticipation of the Emperor's upcoming visit to Skyrim, Gaius Maro has been assigned by his father to verify the security of the 5 largest hold capitals in Skyrim. These five cities are Solitude, Markarth, Whiterun, Riften, and Windhelm. Gaius Maro follows a specific schedule in his travels. It is surprising that Gaius is still expected to inspect the security of Windhelm, since Windhelm is currently the headquarters of Ulfric Stormcloak's rebellion against the Empire, and it is quite unlikely that the Emperor will be visiting there anytime soon.\r\nThough his father seems a bit paranoid about Gaius' safety when traveling across Skyrim, Gaius is not particularly worried. Gaius believes that not much could go wrong with his mission, since he's just inspecting security, and not charging off into battle.\r\nGaius is a relatively young Imperial man with green eyes, dark shoulder-length hair, and a beard. He wears a complete set of Penitus Oculatus equipment, including the armor, bracers, boots, and helmet. He carries an Imperial sword on his belt, and is a capable fighter.\r\nGaius is informally romantically involved with a Nord woman named Faida, who works as the innkeeper of Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge.\r\nGaius will become offended and hostile if the Emperor is verbally threatened.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to.\"\r\n\"You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now.\"\r\nIf someone threatens him: \"Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant head from its shoulders.\"\r\nIf someone tries to engage in small talk with him: \"I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along.\"",
