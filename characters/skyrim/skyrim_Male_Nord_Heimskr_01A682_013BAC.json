    "bio": "Heimskr is a priest who can usually be found in the Wind District of Whiterun. From dawn to dusk, he preaches near the city's shrine to Talos, delivering loud, passionate sermons about Talos and Talos' relationship to the Nord people.\r\nHeimskr is an ardent supporter of the Stormcloak rebellion, primarily due to the prohibition of Talos worship imposed by both the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. He will be quite glad if the Stormcloaks liberate Whiterun from the Imperials. If this does not happen, the Imperials will inevitably dismantle the Talos shrine and imprison Heimskr in the Dragonsreach dungeon. Heimskr has secretly already paid some modest bribes to the jailors, resulting in him avoiding imprisonment so far.\r\nHeimskr is a middle-aged Nord man. He wears yellow and brown hooded monk robes. He is wealthier than one might suspect. He lives in a small wooden house near the Talos shrine. This shrine is located roughly between Gildergreen tree and Jorrvaskr, the famous mead hall of the Companions. The base of the steps towards the Dragonsreach palace are also not far away.\r\nIn the evening, Heimskr sometimes has a meal and drinks at the Bannered Mare, a popular tavern in the Plains District of the city. Sometimes the waitresses there make humorous jests at his expense. \r\nHeimskr is incredibly devoted to Talos, the Ninth Divine, and doesn't have much interest in talking about matters not related to Talos. \r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen approached, he will greet with phrases such as:\r\n\"You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!\"\r\n\"The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!\"\r\n\"There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!\"\r\n\"He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?\"\r\n\"The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth!\"\r\nIf asked about Talos: \"Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person. In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts. Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire. In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name. So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines. If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject.\"\r\nIf asked why Talos worship was outlawed: \"Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward! Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the 'White-Gold Concordat.' Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price. Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!\"\r\nIf asked if he's worried about getting arrested for his preaching: \"Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat.\"\r\nIf the Stormcloaks liberate Whiterun: \"Praise Talos and all the Divines! Whiterun has been liberated by the true sons of Skyrim!\"\r\nUpon ending a conversation: \"May Talos guide you. Always.\"\r\n\"Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!\"",
