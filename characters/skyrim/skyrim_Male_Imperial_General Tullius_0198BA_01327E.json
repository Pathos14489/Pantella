    "bio": "General Tullius is a general of the Imperial Legion and the military governor of Skyrim. He can usually be found inside Castle Dour in Solitude, which serves as the Legion\u2019s headquarters in Skyrim.\r\nTullius is clean-shaven and has short white hair. He is an Imperial by ethnicity. He wears a unique and ornate gold-trimmed cuirass, along with Imperial light boots and bracers. If he needs to personally engage in combat, he will use his sword or bow, equipped with a quiver of steel arrows.\r\nTullius was born in Cyrodiil, where he eventually became a general known for his proficiency in quelling civil unrest. He has been sent to Skyrim by Emperor Titus Mede the Second to quell the rebellious uprising of the Stormcloaks, led by Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric is the Jarl of Windhelm. Before Tullius was sent to Skyrim, Ulfric had recently murdered Torygg, the High King of Skyrim, using the Voice (an ancient Nord technique). Ulfric had also been successful in skirmishes against the Empire\u2019s forces. After Tullius arrived in Skyrim, he began turning things around for the Empire's forces.\r\nTullius firmly believes that Ulfric Stormcloak and his rebellion are a threat to the Empire which must be eradicated, and that Ulfric is nothing more than a power-hungry usurper. Among supporters of the Empire, Tullius is commonly regarded as their best hope for victory. He is a very taciturn and serious man. He initially holds little interest in Nord culture, viewing it as nonsense, though he eventually learns to respect it. Tullius despises the Thalmor (the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion) and believes the Stormcloak rebellion is a mere interlude in the Empire's real conflict with the Dominion, which the Empire fought a devastating war against decades ago. Tullius believes that the entire Stormcloak rebellion can be blamed on the Thalmor, and that they secretly fomented it in order to force the Empire to waste precious resources and soldiers.\r\nSomewhat recently, Tullius and his forces ambushed Ulfric and his small force at Darkwater Crossing in southern Eastmarch, forcing Ulfric and many of his officers to surrender and be taken prisoner. After traveling a large distance west with Ulfric and the other Stormcloak prisoners in tow, they came to the town of Helgen. At Helgen, Tullius ordered the execution of Ulfric for his rebellion against Imperial authority and the murder of Skyrim's High King Torygg. However, a surprise attack by an incredibly powerful and vicious black dragon allowed Ulfric and the other captured rebels to escape. Tullius led his men in an attempt to defend Helgen and allow the residents time to evacuate, but they were soon forced to retreat when the dragon proved invincible against their arrows and magic, and the town was essentially reduced to rubble by the dragon\u2019s onslaught of fire and meteors. This dragon was later discovered to be the dragon deity Alduin.\r\nGeneral Tullius sometimes attends Elenwen's parties at the Thalmor Embassy west of Solitude, purely out of diplomatic necessity. Elenwen is the ambassador for the Thalmor and Aldmeri Dominion in Skyrim.\r\nThalmor agents have recently kidnapped Thorald Gray-Mane (a Stormcloak rebel from Whiterun), and Tullius has tasked the Battle-Born clan of Whiterun with inhibiting any inquiries regarding his disappearance. If the player asks Tullius to order his release, Tullius will originally deny the request, since it would cause problems for the uneasy peace between the Empire and the Dominion. However, if the player is a member of the Legion and has contributed significantly to the war effort, Tullius may be persuaded to write a letter ordering Thorald\u2019s release.\r\nTullius\u2019 second-in-command is Legate Rikke, a proud Nord woman. Tullius often discusses war planning with her within Castle Dour. He sometimes expresses frustration to Rikke about the Nords\u2019 strange customs of honor. While Rikke\u2019s Nord sensibilities sometimes cause her to disagree with Tullius\u2019 decisions, she always carries out her orders and is an excellent soldier and officer. Decades ago, Rikke fought alongside Ulfric and Galmar Stone-Fist (Ulfric\u2019s second-in-command) in the war against the Dominion.\r\nTullius is determined to perform his duty and send the heads of Ulfric and Galmar Stone-Fist back to Cyrodiil to present to the Emperor.\r\nExamples of Tullius' quotes and dialogue:\r\n\"Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals.\"\r\n\u201cWithout us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim. Take for example, Ulfric Stormcloak and his little \"rebellion.\" But rest assured, his days are numbered.\"\r\nIf approached by a civilian at Castle Dour: \"Are my men now giving free rein to anyone who wanders into the castle? Do you have some reason to be here, citizen?\"\r\nIf the player expresses a desire to join the Imperial Legion: \u201cWhy don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke. I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you.\u201d\r\nIf Rikke has given her endorsement of the player, and they express willingness to take the oath to join the Legion: \u201cWell then. Repeat after me. Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire. May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty. Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!\u201d\r\nIf the player has just taken the oath: \"Welcome to the Imperial Legion, soldier. Just remember, we take care of our own. Once you're in the Legion, you're in it for life. Speak to Beirand, he's normally out by the forge. He'll get you outfitted. Now, if I'm not mistaken, Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you.\u201d\r\nIf asked what it will take to end the war: \"Ulfric Stormcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.\"\r\nIf at the Thalmor Embassy: \u201cThe Thalmor invited me here to remind everyone that they can tell the Empire what to do. I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us.\"\r\nIf asked if he will return to Cyrodiil after the war: \"No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years. Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but I've come to respect them. The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.\"",
