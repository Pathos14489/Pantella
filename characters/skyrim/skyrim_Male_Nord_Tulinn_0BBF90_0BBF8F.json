    "bio": "Tulinn, a Nord man, works as a carriage driver. With his horse-drawn carriage, he transports customers from Falkreath to one of the few dozen major settlements scattered across Skyrim.\r\nFalkreath is the capital of Falkreath Hold. Falkreath Hold's terrain consists of forests in the west, Lake Ilinalta the White River in the north, and mountainous trails in the south and east.\r\nThe cost of Wilhod's carriage ride services depends on the distance from Falkreath to the customer's requested destination. The trip can cost up to 80 gold if the customer's destination is a city at the northern edge of Skyrim, such as Winterhold.\r\nWhen not traveling or waiting for potential customers from atop his carriage just outside Falkreath, Tulinn sometimes visits Dead Man's Drink. Dead Man's Drink is Falkreath's most popular tavern/inn, and is run by an Imperial woman named Valga Vinicia.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Need a ride?\"\r\nIf asked to for a ride to Morthal: \"Ah, Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Whiterun or Solitude, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.\"",
