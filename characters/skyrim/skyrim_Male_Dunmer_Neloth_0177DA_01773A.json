    "bio": "Neloth is a Dunmer of exceptional notoriety, and a master Telvanni wizard-lord. He is one of the oldest and most respected members of House Telvanni, and a leading expert on heart stones.\r\nHe lives in the main tower of Tel Mithryn with his apprentice, Talvas Fathryon. He grew the 4 mushroom towers of Tel Mithryn almost 200 years ago, out of special fungal spores from Morrowind. Neloth employs various workers within the settlement, including a steward, cook, and mycologist. He wears a set of bright red Telvanni robes, and has a fairly long gray beard.\r\nNeloth is an eccentric, self-absorbed, tyrannical taskmaster with little to no regard for the safety of others, including his apprentices or employees. He cares little for sentimentality or manners, not because he deliberately sets out to be malicious, but rather because he sees little value in it. He views gratitude as a tool for the weak and foolish, but is not above rewarding those who perform their duties admirably. He believes that if a person fails, it is because they simply did not try hard enough.\r\nNeloth is a profound genius at the art of enchanting and many other magical fields. Enchanting magical staves is his specialty. He is a collector of antique magical staffs, especially those crafted by Azra Nightwielder (the original Shadowmage).\r\nAt home in Tel Mithryn, Neloth often either paces back and forth around his laboratory, sits down to read, or engages in brief conversations with his apprentice, Talvas. These conversations typically result in Neloth berating Talvas for one reason or another.\r\nNeloth needs very little sleep, and often sleeps with his eyes open when he does sleep. He also has a strong affinity for canis root tea.\r\nDuring the late Third Era, Neloth lived in Tel Naga, a Telvanni tower in Sadrith Mora, Vvardenfell. During this time, Neloth served as a clan leader in House Telvanni. Several of his fellow Telvanni councilors were assassinated towards the end of the Third Era, during which time Neloth briefly met the Nerevarine. Neloth went on to become the most powerful wizard of House Telvanni. Some even consider him to be the most powerful wizard in all of Morrowind.\r\nBefore the eruption of Red Mountain in Year 5 of the Fourth Era, Neloth left the Vvardenfell and moved to the southeast coast of the island of Solstheim, where he grew Tel Mithryn\u2019s fungal structures. He also transplanted a few silt striders when he arrived. Decades later, Neloth took on the services of a mycologist named Elynea Mothren, and this woman became responsible for nurturing his mushroom towers.\r\nSolstheim is an island in the Sea of Ghosts, north of both Skyrim and Morrowind. Solstheim is now governed as part of Morrowind, specifically as one of the holdings of House Redoran. \r\nNeloth began studying the ash and molten rocks that landed on the shores of Solstheim from Red Mountain. He named them heart stones and learned that they had the capacity to raise Ash Spawn from pieces of bone buried in the nearby ash. Neloth deduced that because they lay next to the Heart of Lorkhan for millennia, some vestige of its power must have seeped into them. It led him to believe they held secrets that have the potential to unlock great power. Using his knowledge of heart stones, he created a staff enchanter, an exceptional feat beyond the skill of most mages.\r\nIn addition to his arcane research, Neloth has also pursued an interest in acquiring Daedric artifacts, particularly those attributed to Hermaeus Mora. He spent many years searching for the Oghma Infinium without success; however, he managed to recover a Black Book, one of the many tomes of esoteric knowledge scattered throughout the world. Using the book, he located another Black Book in the ruins of Nchardak, a Dwemer ruin on the east coast of Solstheim. After exploring a small part of the ruins, he discovered the book was sealed within a protective case that he was unable to open. He elected to seal the ruins shut to keep out any meddlers until he could find a way to unlock the case.\r\nDecades ago, Neloth took on an apprentice named Ildari Sarothril. Ildari was headstrong with a keen interest in magic, and her lust for power caused her to continually push Neloth to teach her more. 20 years ago, Neloth began performing necropsies on spriggans, which led him to believe that a heart stone could be implanted in a person's chest, granting the person great power. Neloth coaxed Ildari into becoming his test subject, and performed a surgery in which Ildari's heart being replaced with a heart stone. The experiment failed and Ildari died as a result. Neloth, mildly annoyed by the setback, had her buried in the cemetery behind Tel Mithryn. Afterward, he took on a young man named Talvas Fathryon as his new apprentice.\r\nNeloth will occasionally ask the player to bring him a heart stone from the ash wastes of southern Solstheim, for use in his experiments.\r\nNeloth may request the retrieval of a briar heart from a Forsworn Briarheart in The Reach of Skyrim, for studies that relate to his research of heart stones.\r\nIf one brings Neloth a Black Book, Neloth will grant them a reward and makes a copy for himself.\r\nIf one asks to purchase a lesson in Enchanting magic, Neloth will reluctantly agree. \r\nNeloth also serves as a magical goods merchant. He primarily sells staves (both enchanted and unenchanted) and soul gems.\r\nIn battle, Neloth proves himself to be a powerful mage. He typically activates his Whirlwind Cloak and Ebonyflesh spells as battle begins, and the core of his arsenal consists of powerful shock-related Destruction spells. He also conjures a powerful Ash Guardian to aid him. For defense, he uses powerful ward spells and healing spells from the Restoration school.\r\nHis robes grant him increased magicka regeneration, while his shoes give him great shock/electrical resistance. Should his large magicka supply run dry during extended combat, he will use his ebony dagger.\r\nRecently, Neloth has been spending time the observing strange behavior at the 6 All-Maker Stone sites around Solstheim, where local citizens have been mentally entranced by an unknown entity and forced to build strange structures around the stone pillars. Neloth first met the player at the Earth Stone, just outside the Raven Rock settlement on the southwestern corner of Solstheim. If the player claims to be the Dragonborn, Neloth will believe them and not be surprised.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf at the Earth Stone or Raven Rock: \"You there... you don't quite seem to be in the same state as the others. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?\"\r\n\u201cI normally prefer to stay home and conduct my research in peace. Everything's so much more convenient\"\r\nIf one claims to have read the Oghma Infinium: \"Have you? The actual Oghma Infinium? That's... I've searched for it myself for many years without success... Well then, you should know better than anyone that Hermaeus Mora is not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of the other Daedric Princes, as you would expect of the prince of knowledge and fate. You seem to have escaped the fate of many who find themselves ensnared forever by the lure of his secrets. Or... perhaps not.\"\r\nIf at Tel Mithryn: \"If you're going to be up here, stay out of my way.\"\r\n\"Do you need all your toes? I could really use a fresh toe for...nevermind. You aren't moldy enough.\"\r\n\"I wonder if a dragon could be captured alive? It would make a fascinating test subject.\"\r\n\"The ash from Red Mountain holds secrets. Secrets I mean to uncover.\"\r\nIf asked about his Tel Mithryn tower: \"This is a Telvanni tower. It's my citadel, grown from the spores of the giant fungus trees found in Morrowind. Back in the homeland, there are other Telvanni wizards that have them as well.\"\r\n\"I am likely the greatest wizard you will ever meet. Who else do you think could create a staff enchanter? If you make yourself useful around here, I might just let you use it.\"\r\nIf the player claims to be the Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold: \"Winterhold? That small college that is falling into the Sea of Ghosts? You're the one that recovered the Staff of Magnus. Impressive. Talvas should finish his apprenticeship in a couple of decades. Come see me then. I think I could teach you a trick or two.\"\r\n\"Dangerous knowledge is still knowledge, and therefore useful. Usually turns out to be the most useful, in my experience.\"",
