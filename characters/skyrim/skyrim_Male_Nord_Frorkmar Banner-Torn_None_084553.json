    "bio": "Frorkmar Banner-Torn is a Nord warrior, soldier and Stormcloak General in Skyrim who is stationed in The Pale.\r\nHe can usually be found in Dawnstar inside The White Hall or in the Pale Stormcloak Camp, if Dawnstar is taken by the Empire during the Civil War questline.\r\nLegate Rikke will order the Dragonborn to take some forged documents to the Stormcloak General Frorkmar Banner-Torn in Dawnstar.\r\nI have important documents for you, sir. \"All right. Let's take a look... Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent. It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done. Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?\"",
