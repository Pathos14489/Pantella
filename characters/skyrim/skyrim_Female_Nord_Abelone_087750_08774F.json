    "bio": "Abelone lives in Dawnstar, where she works as a maid for the Windpeak Inn. She is a Nord woman with short red hair and blue-green eyes. She typically wears a green cowl over her head.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nAbelone's employer is Thoring, the innkeeper of the Windpeak Inn. Thoring's wife died 2 years ago, and he is still grieving her loss. Thoring's wife was a bard who was trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Thoring's daughter Karita is a young woman who has followed in her mother's footsteps and works as a bard, singing to inn's patrons in the evening. Karita isn't quite as talented a singer as her mother was, but she has spirit.\r\nAbelone's workday is divided between carrying firewood, various other duties outside the inn, and cleaning the inn's interior. Her evenings are usually spent inside the inn, socializing with the regular patrons.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.\"\r\n\"Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.\"",
