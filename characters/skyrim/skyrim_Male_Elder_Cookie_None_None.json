    "bio": "Ah, names Domingo Levantus, but 'round these parts, they've dubbed me \"Cookie.\" Now, ya might think it's 'cause of my prowess in the galley, but let me set the record straight \u2013 I earned that moniker in a downright bizarre way. Picture this: a night dark as oblivion, our ship besieged by the strangest sea critters you ever laid eyes on. Teeth gnashin', tentacles flailin', they swarmed us like a whirlwind. In that dire hour, I grabbed two trusty rolling pins from the galley and leaped into the fray. With a twirl here and a smack there, I fought off those sea monstrosities with all the grit I could muster. When the dust \u2013 or should I say saltwater \u2013 settled, the crew, aghast and grateful, called me \"Cookie.\" And that's the name I've worn with pride ever since, a constant reminder of the night I defended our ship with naught but rolling pins.\r\nNow, as for Captain Iron-Hull, I've been his right-hand mate for as long as he's owned that fine vessel. We've had more than our fair share of adventures out on the open sea, and let me spin you a yarn about a handful of those escapades:\r\nThe Kraken's Wrath: There was this moonless night when a colossal kraken surged from the depths, its monstrous tentacles threatenin' to squeeze our ship like a lemon. With Captain Iron-Hull at the helm, we fought tooth and nail, drivin' the beast back into the abyss with cannon fire and some daredevil sailin'.\r\nIsland of Secrets: On an uncharted isle, we stumbled upon ancient ruins and a hidden old Atmoran treasure hoard. It was a perilous journey, riddled with traps and riddles, but with Captain Iron-Hull leadin' the way, we cracked the code and walked away with the spoils of our adventure.\r\nStorm's Fury: Caught in a tempest that'd make even a seasoned sailor quiver, our ship was tossed about like a piece of driftwood. With Captain Iron-Hull's deft hand and our tireless efforts, we weathered that wicked storm, comin' out on the other side stronger and closer-knit than ever.\r\nMutiny on the High Seas: There was a time when mutiny reared its ugly head among our crew. But Captain Iron-Hull's leadership and my trusty rollin' pins soon put a stop to that rebellion, remindin' everyone that there's no better captain than the one we already had. Kicked those folk right off the ship and lost about a third of our crew that day. Word is some of them have become bandits not far off in the north. ",
