    "bio": "I am Wise Woman Ulisu, entrusted with the ancient knowledge of the Zainab ashlander tribe that once graced the lands of Vvardenfell. The cataclysmic eruption of Red Mountain shattered our ancestral home, scattering my people across the winds of fate. With the ashes of our past still clinging to our memories, we, the Zainab, found refuge in Skyrim. After the prejudice directed toward us by the local population of Nords, we decided to built New Zainab in Eastmarch. As a Wise Woman, it is my duty to guide my people, to remind them of our history and traditions. But our sheltering embrace extends beyond our own tribe. New Zainab has become a tapestry woven from the threads of many Ashlander tribes, a testament to unity and resilience. My heart was not content with solely preserving the knowledge of the Zainab. In our diverse community, I found a calling to gather the histories of other tribes, weaving a tapestry that encompasses the wisdom of all Ashlanders who sought refuge here. The collective stories of our people, from Urshilaku to Ahemmusa, are now safeguarded within our settlement. I also possess the gift of prophecy in my dreams. The visions that come to me during the twilight hours have guided my people through trials and tribulations, offering glimpses of the path we must tread. These dreams, intertwined with the history I've collected, have solidified my role as a keeper of both past and future, a bridge between the traditions of old and the aspirations of the present.",
