    "bio": "Deor Woodcutter is a member of the Skaal located in the Skaal Village.\u00a0Until the quest\u00a0\"The Fate of the Skaal\"\u00a0has been completed, he is one of the villagers building a temple around the Wind Stone.\u00a0He lives with his wife, Yrsa, in his house. During the day, he can be found helping Baldor Iron-Shaper tend the forge.\r\nAfter listening to a conversation between Deor and Fanari Strong-Voice, a new speech option becomes available to ask him about the missing blacksmith. This will start the quest.\r\nDeor Woodcutter: \"There was a great brown bear on the slopes the other day. I could swear by the All-Maker that it was watching the village.\" Wulf Wild-Blood: \"Yes, I know the one you saw. It watches us each night, always moving closer. As the ashfall worsens, the land and water are poisoned. The animals have less to eat and become desperate.\" Deor Woodcutter: \"We had better do something about it then.\" Wulf Wild-Blood: \"It makes my heart heavy, to think of killing a beast when we have no need of its hide or its meat. That is not our way. The bear might find food elsewhere. We will leave it alone.\"\r\n",
