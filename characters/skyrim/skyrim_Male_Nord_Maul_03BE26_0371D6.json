    "bio": "Maul is a\u00a0Nord and an associate of the Thieves Guild living in Riften. He is the righthand man of Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the Black-Briars. He is also the brother of Thieves Guild member Dirge. Once the player first enters Riften, Maul will warn the Dragonborn not to cause trouble. If Maven becomes Jarl of Riften, Maul will become her housecarl.\r\nMaul is a former member of the Thieves Guild, having left the organization after it began to decline. He was offered a job working for Maven Black-Briar, accepted, and never went back.\r\nAfter speaking with him inside Riften, he will exit the town and can be found loitering around the docks. If one wants to bring an Unusual Gem to him before they have joined the Thieves Guild, he will insist that the Dragonborn join the Guild before he looks at it. At this point, the quest will expand, with an objective to join the Guild.\r\nHe can tell you about a boy in Windhelm trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. This leads to the miscellaneous quest to talk with Aventus Aretino.",
