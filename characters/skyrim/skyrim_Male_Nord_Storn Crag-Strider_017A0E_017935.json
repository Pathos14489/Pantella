    "bio": "Storn Crag-Strider is the Elder shaman of the Skaal Village and the father of Frea. He lives in the Shaman's Hut, where he can be found at night.\r\n\r\nStorn is met when returning to the village with Frea. The Dragonborn tells him of the vision at the Temple of Miraak. Storn's fears had come to pass, and he sends the Dragonborn to Saering's Watch, to find a Dragon Shout that Miraak learned long ago. Upon completion of that quest, he gives two more quests: \"Cleansing the Stones\" and \"The Path of Knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nAfter cleansing the Wind Stone, Storn tasks the Dragonborn with cleansing the remaining stones of Solstheim.\r\n\r\nStorn will mention how the wizard Neloth asked about Black Books when he came to the Skaal Village. The Dragonborn is then tasked with heading to Tel Mithryn, but they can ask Storn what he knows of the books.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince will say that he will trade the last word of the Bend Will shout in exchange for the secrets of the Skaal. After talking to Storn, he will be conflicted over what to do, but ultimately decides to complete the deal with Herma-Mora in order to defeat Miraak.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked what happened at the Wind Stone: \"The power of the Stone had been corrupted. It was the source of the influence that had taken control of the Skaal. Your Shout broke whatever evil will controlled the Stone, and restored its true nature as a conduit of the All-Maker's gift. Freeing the other Stones will diminish the whatever dark influence is spreading across Solstheim.\"\r\n",
