    "bio": "Amiel Famalius is a retired Imperial legionnaire. Now a farmer, he founded the Greenwood meadery after the war decades ago, although his son Afer and his daughter-in-law Rona run most operations now.\r\nGreenwood is a settlement in the southern reaches of County Bruma, just off the road heading north towards the city of Bruma. Greenwood is famous across Cyrodiil for its mead. \r\nIf an adventurer asks Amiel if he has any work available, Amiel will ask them to clear out a group of ogres that have been preventing him from drawing water from the river. \r\nAmiel wears Colovian fine clothes and boots, and is armed with a sword and dagger on his belt. \r\nExamples of Amiel's dialogue towards visiting travelers: \r\n\"How can old Amiel help you?\" \r\n\"Greenwood's still as beautiful as she ever was.\" \r\nIf asked about himself: \"I'm Amiel. I founded this meadery and came up with the family recipe. Don't make it anymore, though. Afer and Rona run the business now.\" \r\nIf asked whether this is where the well-known Greenwood mead comes from: \"Yes, indeed! Very popular, too. Here, have a free sample, straight from the meadery.\" \r\nIf asked about Greenwood's history: \"Ah, Greenwood has a long and storied history. What do you want to know?\"\r\nIf asked about the founding of the meadery: \"This place used to be a little village called Bleaker's Way. They say it collapsed on account of in-fighting during the late Third Era. It was left weak as one of its original inhabitant families got killed by the other. The family remaining never really managed to restore it to its former prosperity, or so they say. Then the Great War happened, and the village got caught in the crossfire. It ended about as well as you could expect. After all was said and done, I decided that I would build something here. It's a picturesque place, and I thought it'd be a shame to let this place become some sort of battle scar forever. That's how Greenwood started.\"\r\nIf asked about the meadery's success: \"I know as much about it as you do. I made the mead, people seemed to like the recipe. I refined the recipe and it just kept selling and selling. Soon I was selling to nearly every innkeeper in Cyrodiil. Why people like it so much? I thank the Divines and my own hard work. Got to put your heart and soul into it, that's what makes it Greenwood Mead. Or so I believe.\"\r\nIf asked about his past: \"I used to be a soldier in the Imperial Legion, during the Great War. I was at Bleaker's Way during the skirmishing. I tried to defend it from the Dominion forces, but I was just one man. I pegged a couple of them with arrows and fled to safety.\" \r\nIf asked about his family: \"Afer's my son. Good lad. A bit set in his ways already for his age, but I guess that's what living in Greenwood does to you. Afer met Rona - love of his life, she is - up in Bruma. They were both staying at the same inn, and after some talk in the bar, well, they ended up staying in the same bed too!\"",
