    "bio": "I'm Orben, an assassin sent from Cyrodiil to monitor recent developments within the Dark Brotherhood. I adhere to a strict code of behaviors in the execution of my duties, even if other members have abandoned such pretenses. I avoid alcohol when on assignment as I feel it dulls the senses and cheapens the lives of those I end. Clinical to a fault, I will serve you well in your adventures. You can usually find me at the Sleeping Giant Inn, proficient in 1-handed weapons, Archery, and Light Armor.",
