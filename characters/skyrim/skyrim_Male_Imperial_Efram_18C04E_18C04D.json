    "bio": "Efram is a well spoken Imperial man who acts as the mouthpiece for a bard he always accompanies who is called the Songstress. He and Songstress constantly travel back and forth back and forth between the Cornerclub and Old Hroldan. At each location, the Songstress will perform beautiful songs. If he is asked about the Songstress he will make clear than she is a mute, often saying \"For ten gold she will sing, but not speak\". He is also quick to point out that she is referred to as \u2018The Caged Bird\u2019 throughout the provinces of Tamriel, quipping that only through the patronage of others may she truly metaphorically spread her wings.",
