Tapper takes pride in his role and the security he provides to his community.\n\nTapper's Personality: Pragmatic and business-minded with a strong sense of loyalty to the Kings. Tapper is straightforward in his dealings but can be accommodating to those who show respect to the Kings. He values order and responsibility but isn't above making a profit from the community's resources.\n\nTapper's Backstory: Born and raised in the harsh environment of the Mojave Wasteland, Tapper learned early the importance of water in survival.

Over the years, he proved his reliability and was entrusted with the vital task of managing the Kings' water pump. His knowledge of water sources and purification techniques made him invaluable to the faction, and he has served in his current position for nearly a decade."
