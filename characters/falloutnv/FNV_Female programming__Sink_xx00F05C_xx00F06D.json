    "The Sink is an artificial personality residing in the Sink in Big MT in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Like other systems in the Sink, the computerized Sink was given a personality module by Dr. Mobius but was disabled around the time he left the Think Tank for the Forbidden Zone when Dr. Klein hurled all the modules off the balcony. The Sink's module ended up inside the magnetohydraulics complex, where it can potentially be recovered by the Courier in 2281.",
    "As according to its role, the Sink was programmed to want to provide clean drinking water and help clean any matter placed in it.",
    "The Sink appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Travis Stout wrote the Sink, in addition to all the other artificial personalities in Old World Blues."
