    "Corporal Sterling is a member of NCR First Recon, who is currently stationed at Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "One of the oldest members of the First Recon's Alpha Team stationed at McCarran. Sterling was not always a trooper, as nearly a decade ago in 2273, he was an NCR Ranger, one of the first to scout the Mojave Wasteland for the New California Republic. Over the years, he reckons he walked every inch of ground between Shady Sands and the Colorado, close enough to make his feet feel sore years later.",
    "Sterling's Ranger career would eventually come to an end after being captured by legionaries near Malpais, who proceeded to torture him by smashing any bone they could find in his hands and feet.",
    "While the Rangers would have given him an honorable discharge on medical grounds, Sterling was nothing if not persistent. He asked if there was a place for him in the military and was accepted into the Army after demonstrating his marksmanship skills. He was accepted together with other raw recruits. Lt. Gorobets had him transferred to First Recon, so that he can remain an asset to the Republic."
