    "Blade is the last of the four unique marked men encountered at the Divide in 2281.",
    "Blade is a scout residing near the entrance to Ulysses' Temple in the Divide. His health and combat skills are higher than those of a normal marked man and are on par with those of a companion. True to his name, he is a sword fighter whose primary weapon is the Blade of the West, although he initially attacks the Courier from a distance by throwing plasma grenades.",
    "Blade moves 15% faster than a normal non-player character and deals 25 extra points of melee damage per hit. He also uses a Stealth Boy, allowing him to get into close melee range without being noticed and preventing him from being targeted using V.A.T.S.",
    "Blade appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Lonesome Road.",
