    "Muggy is a robot residing in the Sink in Big MT in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Muggy was designed to be a neurotic, sentient, highly self-aware, miniature Securitron by Doctor 0 as an expression of 0's own hatred for Robert House and RobCo Industries. Unlike other Securitrons, Muggy's screen does not feature a policeman, soldier or broken face, instead displaying a cartoon version of a smiling coffee cup.",
    "Muggy is programmed to be obsessed with cleaning coffee mugs, and fully aware of this obsession as well as his inability to stop or do anything about it.",
    "Muggy harbors a deep-seated resentment of Dr. 0 for creating him which deepened after 0 became a Think Tank.",
    "Muggy's hatred for Dr. 0 runs so deep that after the Courier confronts the scientists in their dome, he frantically asks if they violently killed him, although the Courier never confirms 0's fate to him.",
    "At some point before or during the Courier's time in Big MT, Muggy was tricked by the Biological Research Station into looking for a coffee mug inside its chassis, for which the mini Securitron was then \"seeded,\"",
    "Should the Courier have discovered Higgs Village before the final confrontation, it is shown in an ending that Muggy ended up accidentally locking himself in there trying to clean the dirty dishes. He then comes to enjoy the solitude and being able to clean up the old kitchens of the Think Tank professors, but deliberately leaving 0's house dirty as a form of revenge. If the Courier did not discover Higgs Village before the ending, Muggy gets a flat tire just out of reach of a coffee cup, and the resulting outburst causes his brain to explode.",
    "Muggy will turn all coffee mugs, coffee pots and various plates into useful miscellaneous items. The items he accepts and their respective yields are as follows:",
    "After being upgraded, Muggy, through an interactive request, will provide the Courier with all of the following once a day:",
    "Muggy appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues."
