    "Lieutenant Hayes is an officer of the New California Republic Army stationed in Primm in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281, trying to muster a counteroffensive to take back the town from escaped convicts threatening its citizens. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Prior to October 2281, the lieutenant was posted to 1st Company of the 5th Army Battalion in the New California Republic Army,",
    "With only a slim hope that needed supplies and reinforcements will escape the mess of red tape locking down the Mojave Outpost, Hayes resigns his unit to simple containment rather than direct intervention, ordering his marksmen to block attempts by convicts to escape south and endanger the Outpost from their small camp on the town's western outskirts, but leaving the citizens trapped in the Vikki and Vance Casino to fend for themselves.",
    "Upon his death, a message will appear stating that \"Lieutenant Hayes has died!\" similar to the prompt that appears when a companion dies.",
    "Hayes was originally intended to have a rank of corporal instead of lieutenant, as indicated by his G.E.C.K. Editor ID (PrimmCorporalHayes)."
