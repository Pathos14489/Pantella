    "Chief Hanlon is the commanding officer of the New California Republic Rangers, responsible for coordinating Ranger operations throughout the Mojave Wasteland from their headquarters at Camp Golf in Fallout: New Vegas. He is a grizzled veteran of the republic's war against Caesar's Legion, having commanded the Rangers during the First Battle of Hoover Dam.",
    "Hailing from the heartlands of New California, Hanlon is one of the Rangers' longest-serving members,",
    "Hanlon admits to feeling that many of the things he saw as a Ranger changed him and his relationship with the republic itself. One of these pivotal moments occurred sometime between 2256 and 2261, when he led a six-man team of Rangers to investigate reports of raider attacks on a small settlement called Rattletail in the Baja region. It took the Rangers a week to get to Rattletail, during which the group suffered complications, losing one to night stalkers and another nearly dying of dehydration. What they found upon reaching Rattletail was a slaughter, including 24 bodies shot dead among the dunes by the NCR settlers armed with .308 rifles who had claimed the only well within fifty miles and opened fire on anyone who tried to reach it. Contrary to the reports of vicious raiders, the dead were not heavily armed or raiders, simply desperate wastelanders looking for a drink. To prevent further loss of life, Hanlon sold them a story about an incoming raider army, one hundred strong, and his group losing ten Rangers already on the way in, and offered to escort the settlers back to the NCR, which they accepted and eventually resettled in Anza-Borrego as bighorner ranchers. Since then, Hanlon considers it his one good deed in over 40 years of service.",
    "Despite his doubts about their policies, Hanlon served the Rangers and the republic to the best of his ability. Once in the position of chief himself, Hanlon has developed a legendary reputation for his use of misdirection, traps, and ambushes, frequently executed with the use of explosives, especially mines. He solidified his skill as a strategist in the minds of Caesar's Legion in the wake of the First Battle of Hoover Dam,",
    "Highly influential among the Rangers due to his success and experience, Chief Hanlon has been honored many times for his contributions to the NCR. Although he no longer engages in combat operations, he nevertheless continues to coordinate Ranger operations. As a recognized war hero and a veteran of countless campaigns, he is a powerful influence in military circles and even has the ear of NCR President Aaron Kimball, though the republic's leader tends to favor the advice of his own coterie of war hawks. Hanlon learned this the hard way when his request to reassign the Rangers' veteran members to the Mojave was ignored in favor of deploying them to Baja, on a mission that the chief blithely regards as \"chasing ghosts.\"",
    "Fed up with the bickering and internal politics that have plagued him, Chief Hanlon eventually took a hard look at the Mojave Campaign and came to the conclusion that attempting to hold on to the dam and annex New Vegas would eventually kill the republic. The war with the Legion has left its toll on the Army's men and women, and along with his frustrations at Mr. House's casinos bleeding the NCR's soldiers dry while relying on their protection, Hanlon has been left fearing for the future of the NCR even in the case of victory against the Legion a second time. Hanlon believes the task of trying to hold both sides of the Colorado River is too much for the Army or even the Rangers to maintain long term. His fears have culminated in him undertaking a secret campaign to deliberately sabotage the war effort through manipulating intelligence reports sent in from Ranger stations across the Mojave, trying to convince the top brass that the situation was more hopeless than it was in reality. In the end, he wishes that the NCR would decide to cut its losses and abandon the frontier, putting a stop to the constant shedding of its own blood for territory.",
