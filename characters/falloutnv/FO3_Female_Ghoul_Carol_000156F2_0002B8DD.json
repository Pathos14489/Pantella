    "Carol is a female ghoul denizen of Underworld in Fallout 3. She is the owner and proprietor of Carol's Place, keeping it running together with her partner Greta.",
    "The two are the first same-sex couple to be portrayed in a Fallout game.",
    "Born in 2051,",
    "The city burned for weeks, if not months afterward, and Carol left the shelter, hiding in the Museum of History. She was safe inside, but could hear the chaos unfold outside its walls, with the once affluent city turning into a hellish warzone. Looting and murder were the order of the day, and the nightmarish memories still give Carol pause, even two hundred years after the fact.",
    "Everything improved further after she met Greta around 2217, with the two sharing a life together ever since. Carol decided to fulfill her lifelong dream of being the owner of a bed and breakfast at Greta's insistence,",
    "Though she is a ghoul with all the drawbacks that entails, she proudly wears a sundress and maintains a pleasant disposition in spite of everything she suffered.",
    "Part of the reason is likely the fact that she has lived in Underworld for 200 years, give or take, and after telling the same stories for centuries, she started to feel uninteresting, losing her luster.",
    "Carol is in a committed relationship with Greta,",
    "Her other significant relationship is with Gob, a younger ghoul she \"adopted\" with Greta. He is not her biological child and it is not clear if there is even an age disparity between them, but nevertheless Carol treats him as if he was her flesh and bone.",
    "She is well liked and respected among the Underworld ghouls, along with her establishment, as it is one of the only places for ghouls to spend their money at in Underworld (the others being the Ninth Circle or Tulip's shop).",
    "However, there are exceptions: Carol's competitor Ahzrukhal would like nothing more than to shut Carol's Place down as a watering hole (e.g. by killing Greta),",
    "Carol immediately takes a shine to the Lone Wanderer, who is the first regular human to visit Underworld in a while, and just meeting them is enough to make her snap into her old self. That includes cracking deadpan jokes about smoothskins and their ugliness.",
    "Carol has two packages assigned which govern her schedule:",
