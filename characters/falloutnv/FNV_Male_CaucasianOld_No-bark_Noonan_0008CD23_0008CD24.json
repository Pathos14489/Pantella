    "No-bark Noonan is a resident of Novac in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. Considered the local eccentric, he dwells as a hermit on the town's outskirts, spouting wild, seemingly nonsensical conspiracy theories about local events. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The archetypical \"crazy conspiracy theorist,\" little to nothing is definitively known about \"No-bark\" Noonan's past, including how he ended up as a hermit living on the outskirts of Novac. When asked about his name, he claims to have suffered multiple radscorpion stings in the past that pierced his skull and affected his brain, surviving at the cost of becoming the eccentric, paranoid conspiracy nut that he is today.",
    "His eccentric, paranoid view of life has caused No-bark to suspect everyone in Novac of harboring secrets, and he spends his days wandering around town \"gathering\" information to confirm his \"suspicions.\""
