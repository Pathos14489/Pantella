    "Jericho is a former raider residing in Megaton in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3. He is a possible companion of the Lone Wanderer.",
    "In his past, Jericho was a ruthless and deadly raider, killing and stealing for measly amounts of caps and loot for even the slightest of reasons. After fighting along with other raider gangs for many years and becoming a crack shot with a rifle, Jericho saw fit to retire and settled down in Megaton to enjoy his twilight years. Despite being out of the game for a long time, he has not lost touch with his raider ways. While the smug-lipped, foul-mouth Jericho will lend his marksmanship to protect the town, he more often than not prefers to guzzle booze and spew curses at passersby completely care-free. Rumors are abound that he also occasionally does some odd jobs for Colin Moriarty.",
    "By the time the Lone Wanderer leaves Vault 101 in 2277, Jericho has begun having thoughts about getting back out into the wastes to fight and kill freely, though he'd prefer if he was paid for equipment expenses upfront as a start.",
    "Jericho appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout Shelter.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 Like all other Megaton characters, Jericho might go missing or turn up dead. See recovering missing non-player character in Fallout 3 on how to resolve this issue.",
    "Jericho's name is a reference to the biblical city of Jericho, the remains of which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and considered to be the oldest fortified city in the world."
