    "Max is an orphan residing in Freeside in 2281.",
    "Max can be found in Freeside chasing his friend Stacey with Euclid's C-Finder. However, the safety on the C-Finder was left on, preventing him from activating ARCHIMEDES II.",
    "Freeside is home to many of New Vegas's poorer residents and NCR refugees. Stacey and Max are orphaned street urchins who live in the ruins of the destroyed building immediately inside Freeside's east gate next to Mick & Ralph's. If not found roaming the streets, they may be asleep on two worn mattresses on the second floor of their home.",
    "Max will sell Euclid's C-Finder upon request for 1,000 caps, but by passing a Barter check of 45, will sell it for only 20 caps, and by passing a Speech check of 60 will give it to the player for free.",
    "I Could Make You Care: If one chooses to complete the quest by obtaining Euclid's C-Finder, it will need to be acquired from Max.",
    "An additional dialogue option exists which would allow the player to obtain Euclid's C-Finder for free. However, this dialogue option requires the cut Child at Heart perk, which was removed owing to the small number of children in the Mojave Wasteland."
