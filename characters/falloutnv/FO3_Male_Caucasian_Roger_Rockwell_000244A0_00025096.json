    "Roger Rockwell is one of the inhabitants of Vault 112 trapped within the Tranquility Lane virtual reality simulation in Fallout 3.",
    "Resident 226 of Vault 112,",
    "While Roger eventually managed to convince Janet that nothing was going on between them, few aside from Janet believe it.",
    "He plays it off as just \"women's troubles,\"",
    "Rockwell's vitals indicate a state of elevated stress: 85 beats per minute, 140/90 mmHg of blood pressure, 98.7°F/37.05°C temperature, and 22 breaths per minute, similar to Timmy Neusbaum and Martha Simpson.",
    "When looking at resident IDs, Roger Rockwell and Martha Simpson have adjacent IDs (226 and 227 respectively), while Janet Simpson has the ID 115. As such, it's entirely possible that Rockwell and Simpson were originally a couple, rather than Janet."
