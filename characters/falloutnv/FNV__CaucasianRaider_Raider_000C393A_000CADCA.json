    "The dead body of a raider can be found on the east end of the overpass bridge going east from Novac in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Sometime before the Courier woke up in Goodsprings, this raider met her end just outside of Novac, atop the east overpass near the Dino Bite gift shop. Judging from her location, it can be inferred she was shot by either Craig Boone or Manny Vargas, the two snipers protecting the town night and day, respectively.",
    "Although raider armor can be commonly found in the Mojave, particularly with the Fiends, this character is the only one in the game that is called \"Raider\"."
