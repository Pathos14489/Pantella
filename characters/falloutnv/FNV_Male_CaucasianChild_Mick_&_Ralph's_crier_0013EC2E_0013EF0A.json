  "description": "Timmy is a 11 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA young boy with a wiry frame and dusty brown hair, Timmy stands at the gate between Freeside's west and east sections. He wears patched clothing and carries a makeshift megaphone, his voice surprisingly strong for his size. His eyes dart around alertly, always watching for potential customers.\n\nTimmy's Personality: Energetic and outgoing with a knack for showmanship. Street-smart and pragmatic beyond his years, Timmy understands the value of caps and knows how to get attention. He's friendly but maintains a professional demeanor when on duty.\n\nTimmy's Backstory: Born and raised in Freeside, Timmy's family struggled to make ends meet in the harsh wasteland. When his parents disappeared during a raider attack a few years ago, he was taken in by the owners of Mick & Ralph's, who offered him work in exchange for shelter and meager pay. He's grown up learning the ways of the wasteland while honing his ability to attract customers with his loud, clear voice."
