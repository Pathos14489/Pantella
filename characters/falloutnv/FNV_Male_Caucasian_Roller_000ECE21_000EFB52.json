    "Roller is a co-leader of the Scorpions gang living in the Monte Carlo Suites in 2281.",
    "Along with Yvette, Roller leads the small-time raider gang known as the Scorpions, who are involved in slinging chems within and out of the New Vegas area. Like other raider gangs, the Scorpions will attack strangers on sight.",
    "Roller is usually found making use of a workbench, accompanied by another gang member in a room inside the Monte Carlo Suites.",
    "During development, it may have been planned to allow the Courier to interact with the Scorpions gang, with Roller serving as a merchant dealing in chems, as evidenced by him owning a merchant chest in the vendor cell. This function is not present in the final release."
