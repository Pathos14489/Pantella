    "Argyll is the doctor for the Boomers living at the Nellis Air Force Base in 2281.",
    "He is a doctor for the Boomers at Nellis Air Force Base and can usually be found inside the Nellis medical station. He treats small ailments such as bug bites but also treats more life-threatening conditions.",
    "He will not heal or sell medical supplies to the player character before they have helped the Boomers enough or healed at least two of his patients.",
    "Area designer Robert Lee implemented Argyll and the objective to heal the injured Boomers in the medical station.",
    "PC Xbox 360 Argyll can spontaneously start a fight with Lily, Rex or ED-E for no apparent reason. This occurred after finishing patient treatment dialogue. This is most likely a result of the non-human companions having consumables bug."
