    "Sergeant Daniels is a soldier found in the cryo lab section of Mothership Zeta.",
    "Daniels was the NCO in charge of Elliott Tercorien's medic squad. Assigned to the 108th Infantry Battalion, the six medics handled casualties caused by the Chinese Army during the Battle of Anchorage.",
    "Daniels was not a medic, instead erecting field tents and requesting medical evacuation via radio, after the medics completed field surgery or if the wounds were too severe to be safely treated on the battlefield. He was abducted in the middle of the night with the rest of his squad,",
    "Unlike Tercorien, the rest of his squad were used for torturous medical experiments, which would leave them in horrific pain were they conscious.",
    "Among the Stars",
    "Sergeant Daniels appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta.",
    "Daniels appears to have two voice actors. Most of his dialogue is voiced by the same actor as Elliott Tercorien, who is uncredited and unknown. However, the line said upon his exit from cryostasis (\"Elliott... Is that you? What... What's going on? Where the hell are we?\") is voiced by audio director Mark Lampert. Daniels shares this distinction with Beckett."
