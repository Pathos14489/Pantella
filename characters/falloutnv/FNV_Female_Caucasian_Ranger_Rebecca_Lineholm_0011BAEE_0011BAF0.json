    "NCR Ranger Rebecca Lineholm is the commanding officer of Ranger Station Alpha in 2281.",
    "Ranger Lineholm joined the NCR Rangers in 2271. After grueling training, she experienced the proudest moment of her life when she got her Ranger badge. Currently she's in charge of Ranger Station Alpha, once on the frontlines of the war with the Legion, now a mostly support outpost with a minimal chance of running afoul of critters, raiders, or the Legion.",
    "The NCR Rangers at the ranger stations, including Lineholm, were written by additional area designer Matt MacLean, who worked on the quest Return to Sender."
