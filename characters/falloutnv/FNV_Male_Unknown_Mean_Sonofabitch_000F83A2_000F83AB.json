    "Mean Sonofabitch is a super mutant and member of the Westside Militia residing in the eponymous settlement in the Mojave Wasteland, acting as its powerhouse defender against threats like the Fiends in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A first-generation super mutant \"born\" at Mariposa Military Base, Mean Sonofabitch served the Unity with distinction until the fall of the Master in 2162. Like most super mutants afterward, he wandered the wastes for decades until his luck eventually ran out. Sometime in the second half of the 23rd century, while somewhere near the Hub, the mutant was taken captive by a group of xenophobic mutant-haters who tortured and mutilated him, including cutting out his tongue.",
    "Instead of following Tabitha after his rescue, eventually, the newly freed Mean wandered east into the Mojave Wasteland where he ended up in Westside. There, he reunited with Klamath Bob, who he remembered fondly, and decided to stick around. Day to day, Mean spends his time doing odd jobs for Westsiders and helping the Militia defend their homestead from threats like the Fiends.",
    "* Cannot be pickpocketed or looted from Sonofabitch.",
    "The character of Mean Sonofabitch was written by Joshua Sawyer."
