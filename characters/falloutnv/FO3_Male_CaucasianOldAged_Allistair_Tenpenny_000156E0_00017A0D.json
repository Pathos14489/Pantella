    "Allistair Tenpenny is the founder and owner of Tenpenny Tower, appearing in Fallout 3. He is one of only nine named characters in the base game to have \"Very Evil\" Karma. He is also a Legendary dweller in Fallout Shelter, coming with a unique rifle and suit.",
    "Originally born around 2197",
    "As such, little is known about him before the founding of Tenpenny Tower. What is known is that with his fake aristocratic accent,",
    "Shortly after this botched job, Tenpenny met a man who changed his life: Mister Burke.",
    "The result is one of the only places in the Capital Wasteland where residents can enjoy a quality of life approximating pre-War conditions, thanks to Tenpenny's wealth and Burke's skills.",
    "While Tenpenny believes the tower to be the beginning of something great, rather than his crowning achievement,",
    "Beyond sex and wanton violence, the octogenarian also carefully nurtures his alcoholism, boasting that he \"",
    "In fact, by 2277, it is Mister Burke who is in real control at Tenpenny Tower, with the eccentric Allistair a shut-in figurehead attracting attention with his antics, suffering from madness reserved for the obscenely rich.",
    "Burke is agreeable and proactive, and has taken over so many aspects of the tower's functioning that Tenpenny barely needs to think about things anymore, as Burke is always there to take care of everything, anticipating his needs. Tenpenny does not know how he got along without him. One such instance of Burke's proactiveness is him seizing the chance to wipe Megaton out and pin the blame on Tenpenny, by reacting to Allistair's comment about it being a \"bit of an eyesore.\"",
    "Burke spent weeks putting the plan in motion,",
    "While Burke passes this off as Tenpenny's sole vision, portraying the aged and demented Allistair as a pam of passion, ideals, and an antithesis of the apathetic, blighted men inhabiting the Capital Wasteland, it is not clear how much of that plan is actually Tenpenny's own invention.",
    "Tenpenny rarely leaves his penthouse suite, but for the rare occasion he does, he has a seat reserved in Margaret Primrose's cafe.",
    "Allistair Tenpenny appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout Shelter.",
