    "Defender Rococo Rockfowl is a soldier and heavy-weapons specialist of the Brotherhood of Steel Outcasts, stationed at Fort Independence in Fallout 3.",
    "Rococo Rockfowl is the Outcasts' heavy-weapons specialist at Fort Independence, primarily tasked with guarding the bridge from the Fairfax ruins due to regular raider incursions.",
    "Despite wishing to prioritize the Brotherhood's original mission, Rockfowl enjoyed serving with the Brotherhood of Steel and claims to have no quarrel with Elder Lyons or his branch, though this was not enough to dissuade him from following after Casdin, whose ideology he aligned with more.",
    "Unlike his counterpart Defender Morgan, who is a \"no-nonsense soldier,\" Rockfowl operates in a laid-back manner belying his competence.",
    "The son of an avid reader, Rockfowl's father chose to name him \"Rococo Rockfowl\" after being inspired by reading the Encyclopedia Atomica (Volume VIII Radiology-Saskatchewan) and picking his name out from here.",
    "Defender Rockfowl patrols the highway overpass next to the entrance to Fort Independence.",
    "Rockfowl will attack if the Lone Wanderer decides to start a fight with the Outcasts.",
    "Defender Rockfowl's field report is recorded by a different voice actor than Rockfowl's in-game voice. Protector Casdin's field report, similarly, is also recorded by a different voice actor."
