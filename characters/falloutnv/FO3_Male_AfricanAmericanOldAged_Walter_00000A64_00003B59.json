    "Walter is a resident of Megaton, helping operate and maintain the town's water purifier in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3.",
    "An elderly handyman at 61 years of age, making him one of Megaton's oldest residents,",
    "In the few hours that he is away from maintaining the purifier, he likes to hang around Moriarty's Saloon to drink. He openly has a preference for listening to Enclave Radio, citing it as being \"downright patriotic” when the subject is discussed by the saloon's staff and patrons, though unlike Nathaniel Vargas, his opinion of the organization itself is unknown.",
    "During the daytime, Walter can be found in the water processing plant for most of the day, though sometimes he will step outside for some air. During the night hours, he can be seen drinking in Moriarty's Saloon."
