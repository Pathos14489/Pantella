    "Cutter is a doctor who runs the clinic at Paradise Falls in 2277.",
    "Cutter was born into slavery in the pens at Paradise Falls. As a youth, she learned about wasteland medicine from her mother. After her mother died, Cutter took over the responsibility of taking care of the slaves. However, she became increasingly annoyed with their inability to fight back against their slavers. After almost a decade of being paid for her services, Cutter earned the caps needed to buy her freedom. However, she stayed at Paradise Falls and continues to practice medicine there as a free woman, because the slavers needed a talented medic.",
    "Cutter also stays in Paradise Falls because she enjoys draining wealthy slavers of their caps, a form of retribution for her life as a slave.",
    "However, the slavers are not ignorant of Cutter's feelings towards them. Eulogy Jones collects a portion of Cutter's profits, and says that the slavers keep her around because of that cut, on top of keeping them alive.",
