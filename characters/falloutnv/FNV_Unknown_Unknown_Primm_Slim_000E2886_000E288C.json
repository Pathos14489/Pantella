    "Primm Slim is a robot residing in the Vikki and Vance Casino in Primm, acting as a tour guide for the small-time museum in the building, in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A Protectron programmed to be an \"authentic cowpoke,\" Primm Slim is a pre-War staple of the town of Primm, having been purchased sometime prior to 2077 and customized by the owner of the Vikki and Vance Casino to act as its official spokesbot.",
    "By a stroke of good fortune, Slim was able to weather the nuclear apocalypse and decades of inactivity with hardly any faults or breakdowns, eventually being restored to working order by new residents of the town and resuming his post in the casino.",
    "His perfect record however did not remain spotless for long. Sometime around October 2281, Sammy and Pauline Wins, a pair of wannabe outlaws, hacked into Slim to erase his memory of their successful theft of Vance's 9mm submachine gun and other relics from the casino's museum, planning on starting their own life of crime.",
    "Primm Slim appears in Fallout: New Vegas. He also makes a brief cameo appearance in the credits sequence of the Fallout TV series episode \"The Innovator.\"",
    "Xbox 360 Sometimes Primm Slim can be found destroyed outside the NCR base opposite Primm."
