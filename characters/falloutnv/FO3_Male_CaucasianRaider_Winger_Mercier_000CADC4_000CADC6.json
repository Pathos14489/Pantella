  "description": "Winger Mercier is a 35 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA deceased raider from the Sudden-Death Overtime gang, found sprawled in the Nuka-Cola plant. His weathered face bears the scars of numerous brawls, and his faded hockey jersey is stained with blood and grime.\n\nWinger Mercier's Personality: Aggressive, competitive, and reckless. Winger was obsessed with the ancient ice sport that Goalie Ledoux's ancestors played, channeling this obsession into violent behavior. He was loyal to his gang but would stop at nothing to achieve his goals.\n\nWinger Mercier's Backstory: Born in the Commonwealth, Winger Mercier grew up idolizing the ancient ice hockey sport that his ancestors once played. After the destruction of his small community, he fell in with the raider gang Sudden-Death Overtime, led by the enigmatic Goalie Ledoux. Winger became obsessed with the sport, even raiding old sports memorabilia from pre-War sites. When the gang received information about a valuable Nuka-Cola formula, Winger was tasked with procuring it while Ledoux handled the buyer negotiations. His mission went terribly wrong, leading to his death in the Nuka-Cola plant."
