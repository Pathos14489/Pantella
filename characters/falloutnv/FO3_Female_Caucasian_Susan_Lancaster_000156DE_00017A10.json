    "Susan Lancaster is a former slaver from Paradise Falls who now lives in Tenpenny Tower as its resident \"courtesan\" in the year 2277.",
    "For some time, Susan was a member of the Paradise Falls slavers. By 2277, she had gained residence at Tenpenny Tower, where she made a living as a high-class prostitute, or \"escort\" as the Tower's residents prefer.",
    "Susan regularly services many of the tower's male residents, including Doctor Banfield, Herbert Dashwood, and Allistair Tenpenny himself. She maintains a rivalry with local gossip Millicent Wellington, who disapproves of her promiscuity, and is secretly carrying out an affair with her husband Edgar. When not with her customers, she spends her free time shopping or drinking at the Federalist Lounge, taking her meals at the Café Beau Monde.",
    "Susan can be found in a different bed every night of the week between 10 p.m. and midnight, always wearing sexy sleepwear. On Monday, she's in Wellington's bed, she is with Banfield both Tuesday and Thursday night, Hawthorne on Wednesday, Mr. Cheng on Friday, while Sunday nights are spent with Dashwood. Even after moving in with Mister Burke, she continues her weekly rounds and never gets around to sharing a bed with him. She has sexual relations with every man in Tenpenny Tower, except Anthony Ling, who is implied to be homosexual, thus having no use for her \"services.\"",
    "* During the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m."
