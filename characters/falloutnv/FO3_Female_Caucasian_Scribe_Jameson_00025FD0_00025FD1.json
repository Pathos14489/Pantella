    "Scribe Elizabeth Jameson",
    "Due to her roles within Elder Lyons' chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, Scribe Jameson is tasked with overseeing the archives and library of the Citadel, alongside ensuring the upkeep of the chapter's scrolls.",
    "Although she abhors the notion of assigning the holotags recovery task to an outsider, she finds the alternative of Brotherhood deeds and deaths going unreported as \"unthinkable,\" particularly as the Brotherhood lacks the resources to make proper funeral arrangements, and her need to abide by her duty as a keeper of the scrolls.",
    "Despite such a discrepancy, her priority lies with the Brotherhood, and considers sharing knowledge regarding the holotags as a part of her duty to benefit them.",
    "She is eager to share her knowledge, but being told by the Lone Wanderer that they do not care or asking her to get to the point in her holotags explanations sees her become curt in her responses; she will resort to commenting that she expected no different from an outsider, or providing them minimal details and saying this is all they need to know.",
    "Jameson attempts to conduct herself in as amicable a manner as she can, asking the Lone Wanderer to use the rewards she offers for the holotags in \"good health,\" or upon concluding a conversation wish they \"go with peace and knowledge.\"",
    "Scribe Jameson can be found working in the archives area of the A ring in the Citadel when she is not sleeping."
