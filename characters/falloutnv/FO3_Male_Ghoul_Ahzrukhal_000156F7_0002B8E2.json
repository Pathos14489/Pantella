    "Ahzrukhal is the owner and proprietor of the Ninth Circle bar in Underworld in Fallout 3.",
    "The shrewd and fashionably dressed Ahzrukhal operates the Ninth Circle, Underworld's primary watering hole, where he milks people for all they are worth. He sees life as a simple equation: the more misery his customers suffer, the more money he makes when they come to drown their sorrows.",
    "While he enables his customers' drinking, he keeps his drugs reserved for a more discerning clientele.",
    "Ahzrukhal in general keeps his figurative ear to the ground, staying updated on outside developments, especially in the Mall. Local changes in ownership are of special interest, as it opens potential opportunities for trade and income.",
    "Everything boils down to caps with Ahzrukhal. Competitors like Greta exist to be eliminated and their customers taken over to maximize Ahzrukhal's profits (as a matter of principle).",
    "Furthermore, he will generally respect his customers' privacy, out of simple concern for profits.",
    "He does not appreciate history or cultural artifacts. The only reason he might entertain the notion of purchasing a priceless pre-War item would be to boost his profits. For example, becoming the only owner of a Stradivarius violin in the world,",
    "Ahzrukhal is the owner of Charon. He balks at slavery and calls it an abomination, of course, but their relationship is neither voluntary, nor equitable: Ahzrukhal obtained Charon's contract through unspecified means, becoming his \"employer.\" Due to Charon's conditioning, that means Ahzrukhal has absolute control. His orders range from watching the bar and keeping drunks in line, to hurting anything Ahzrukhal wants to be hurt. Ahzrukhal relishes his control over Charon, and especially the fact that his slave never complains about his lot.",
    "Ahzrukhal sees his fellow ghouls as a source of income (especially if they consistently come up with money, like Patchwork, or reliably purchase Jet, like Snowflake),",
    "Beyond Underworld, he knows Dukov well enough to realize that for all his rudeness and bluster, the man is not a ghoul-hater.",
    "The player can purchase Charon from him for 1,000 caps or by eliminating the competition."
