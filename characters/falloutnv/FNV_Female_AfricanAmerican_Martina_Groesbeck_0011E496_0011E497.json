    "Martina Groesbeck is a woman living in Vault 21 on the New Vegas Strip in 2281.",
    "Martina came to New Vegas to strike it rich as a professional gambler. However, things did not quite go as planned for on the professional part only to lose most of her money. After failing that, she started doing odd jobs, mostly for Sarah Weintraub in keeping Vault 21 clean and tidy, to make a living.",
    "Her biggest score yet, though, is the spot she landed as Captain Ronald Curtis' informant, hanging around casinos (and unknowingly gathering intel for Caesar's Legion).",
    "The Finger of Suspicion: The Courier can rescue her by killing the Omerta thugs, completing a Speech check, or by a dialogue option available upon having completed How Little We Know."
