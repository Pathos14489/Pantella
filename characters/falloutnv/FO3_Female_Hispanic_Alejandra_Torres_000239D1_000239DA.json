  "description": "Alejandra Torres is a 28 year-old Hispanic Female.\n\nAlejandra is a quiet yet intelligent woman in her late 20s, with a thoughtful demeanor and a keen mind for history and mechanics. Having experienced the horrors of slavery firsthand, she now dedicates herself to educating others and fighting for the freedom of all people.\n\nAlejandra Torres's Personality: Alejandra is introspective, patient, and deeply committed to the ideals of freedom and equality. She values knowledge and education, viewing them as tools for liberation. Despite her quiet nature, she possesses a quiet determination and is fiercely loyal to those who share her values.\n\nAlejandra Torres's Backstory: Born in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, Alejandra spent her early years as a slave to a raider group. At the age of 21, she managed to escape and was eventually found by Hamlin, the leader of the Abolitionists. Impressed by her intelligence and resilience, Hamlin welcomed her into the Temple of the Union, where Alejandra found a new purpose. She quickly became the group's teacher, sharing her knowledge of history and mechanics with other freed slaves and those seeking refuge at the memorial."
