    "Friday is a merchant and mechanic of Friday's Repairs in the Pitt around 2277.",
    "Together with Trouble Man, Friday operates her own repair shop and merchant stand where she sells a variety of equipment and repairs broken weaponry. Although she is mild-mannered, she is a ruthless businesswoman.",
    "As business is usually slow, she is ready for the Lone Wanderer to spend their money at her store after their ascent from fighting in the area.",
    "She can be found in Downtown after the battles in the Hole have been completed. She is generally located right above Kai and her approximate location can be found up the stairs by Midea's quarters and across the planks.",
    "Friday appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt."
