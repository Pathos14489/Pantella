    "Janet Rockwell is the wife of Roger Rockwell, living in Tranquility Lane in Fallout 3.",
    "Janet is one of Vault 112's inhabitants, trapped in Tranquility Lane alongside her husband, Roger. She has an affinity for baking and gardening, as well as caring for her appearance with occasional trips to the salon.",
    "She has a dislike for Mabel Henderson, stemming from her being \"a little too nosey\" and questioning if the Lone Wanderer has been asked to pry into her marriage per Mabel's request;",
    "In reality, she is stuck in the Tranquility Lounger at Vault 112, as resident 115, with elevated stress levels: 87 bpm, 140/85 mmHg of blood pressure, 98.2°F/36.7°C temperature, and 18 breaths per minute, similar to Timmy Neusbaum and Martha Simpson.",
    "When looking at resident IDs, Roger Rockwell and Martha Simpson have adjacent IDs (226 and 227 respectively), while Janet Simpson has the ID 115. As such, it's entirely possible that Rockwell and Simpson were originally a couple, rather than Janet."
