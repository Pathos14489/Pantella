    "Doctor Angela Williams is an NCR Office of Science and Industry (OSI) researcher who is a colleague of Thomas Hildern in 2281.",
    "Raised on a cattle ranch out West, Angela Williams is a polite, fair and above all, competent member of the OSI team stationed in the Mojave. Speaking with a characteristic ranch twang, she received a comprehensive education from the Office of Science and Industry early in her life.",
    "Her current assignment is to OSI East, as the head researcher on the Hoover Dam Project. Responsible for optimizing the power output of the dam, Williams knows every inch of the power grid between it and Shady Sands.",
    "She's not particularly fond of her superior, Dr. Hildern, who seems more concerned with the advancement of himself and his agenda, rather than science. It's more than his personality too, as she's well aware of Hildern's tendency to take credit for the work of an entire team or throwing contractors under the proverbial bus in service of his ambition.",
    "There Stands the Grass",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 If the Courier asks Angela's opinion of Thomas Hildern and the Speech check (25) succeeds, the Courier can leave the conversation and repeat this as many times as wanted, getting 25 XP every time. "
