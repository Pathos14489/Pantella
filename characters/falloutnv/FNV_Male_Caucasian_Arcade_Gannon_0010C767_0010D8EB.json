    "Arcade Israel Gannon is a doctor and scientist with the Followers of the Apocalypse residing in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas. He is a possible companion of the Courier.",
    "The only son of Gannon Senior, an officer of the Enclave, and his wife, Arcade was born at the Navarro military base around 2246, a few years after the Chosen One blew up the oil rig. He lost his father at an early age, forming close ties with his mother, but in his own words, he never got over his passing.",
    "Later, Arcade, his mother, and several of the troopers from his father's old unit were forced to abandon the Navarro base, narrowly evading the attack by the New California Republic that wiped it out. Even after escaping Navarro, they still remained in danger from being hunted down by the Brotherhood of Steel,",
    "His time in the Followers helped Arcade find his calling in medicine. He learned everything he knows from the group at their excellent medical facilities in the NCR heartlands,",
    "The NCR leadership eventually realized that remnants of the defeated Enclave had adopted new identities and lived in secret within their borders,",
    "Following the remnants as far from the NCR as the Mojave Wasteland, Arcade settled in the New Vegas area where he integrated with Julie Farkas' chapter of the Followers residing at the Old Mormon Fort in Freeside. He chose to focus on botanical research at Julie's request, trying to come up with alternative treatments for common illnesses and injuries, and ways to produce medical supplies from local flora (eg. stimpaks from barrel cacti). While he considers the research noble, Arcade recognizes it as a waste of time due to the low probability of him actually making a breakthrough.",
    "However, Arcade remains enthusiastic about helping people in general and the downtrodden and hopeless of Freeside specifically.",
    "While Arcade claims he's boring",
    "This same intellect also made him a man of firm convictions. He believes strongly in individual freedom, independence, and self-determination, to the point that if he is forced into servitude, he is willing to commit suicide by any means to escape bondage.",
    "On a global level, he is a firm supporter of the independence of the Mojave from foreign powers or domestic autocrats. He believes that pushing the NCR and the Legion out of the Mojave and toppling Mr. House's autocratic rule would break the chains of the Mojave's denizens, allowing them to forge their own path. In such a case, he is ready to use his Enclave knowledge and technology to maintain order",
    "The only problematic outcomes as far as Arcade's concerned are the autocrats. First, it's Mr. House and his power play, which brings with it disillusionment and breaking of ties with the Followers.",
    "Due to personal conflict over his past, Arcade intentionally deflects personal questions, sometimes audaciously claiming it's specifically to obfuscate past associations with fascists.",
    "The only long-lasting relationships Arcade maintains are with the Enclave remnants who he sees as family.",
    "Despite the remnants' many reassurances, Arcade wishes he knew if he truly is like his father,",
    "Arcade believes his decision to join the Followers was part of finding his own way, choosing a goal and direction of his own, working for something greater than just him.",
    "Arcade will get fed up with the Courier if they do or say things that he dislikes. He has an internal counter of \"dislike\" points that are increased by doing or saying stupid or mean things or doing things that hurt the Followers. Once he has accumulated 3 \"dislike\" points, he will warn the Courier that they are \"acting crazy.\" Most of these possible \"dislike\" points may be obtained during The White Wash quest. At 6 points, he will leave permanently. He also tracks \"like\" points, but those are only used to decide if he will start the For Auld Lang Syne quest early or not.",
    "The \"dislike\" points are triggered by the following statements or actions:",
    "Arcade will leave immediately and permanently if any of the following happens:",
    "Arcade Gannon appears in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "Arcade's voice actor, Zachary Levi, in the voiceover booth",
    "Arcade's endings are intended to reflect that no one is damaged more by reality than the idealist. He does his best to be practical and rational, but there is a strong idealist streak in him/the Followers in general. In some of Arcade's \"best\" endings (meaning, the circumstances he thought he wanted), he is still somewhat disappointed by how things turned out. In his \"worst\" endings, he can wind up bitterly disillusioned, brutally murdered, crucified, casually executed and discarded in a ditch, or even defiantly suicidal.",
    "Arcade is an idealist, so I did not think that he would do harm in his capacity as a doctor, nor would he refuse to provide medical aid even to a mortal enemy.  Yes, Arcade will follow you around and blast everything in the Mojave Wasteland with his plasma defender, but the circumstances of gameplay are different from when he’s put in the position of providing (or not) medical aid.",
    "Arcade is not a pragmatic person, so in the circumstances where he becomes a long-term instrument of Caesar (post-endgame), he disembowels himself rather than living as a tool of evil (in his mind).  His suicide is intended to mirror the death of one of the most notable idealists of the Roman Republic, Cato the Younger.",
    "It is certainly possible that he read other primary sources.  Based on Arcade’s education, it’s likely that the Followers of the Apocalypse had access to other Roman and Greek literature, including writings by Sallust and Lucan.",
    "As Arcade and Caesar both know Latin, it is likely that the textbooks they used also contained snippets of Roman literature and quotes as sententiae antiquae (very common in Wheelock’s and many other books). Because the primary purpose of contemporary (i.e., 20th/21st century) Latin education is typically not conversation or writing, but comprehension of classic literature, the use of these quotes/references is common, though often without context."
