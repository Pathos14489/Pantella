    "The Book Chute, or Library Processing Unit 232.7, is an artificial personality in the Sink in Big MT. It appears in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "The Book Chute is a mechanical device located in the Sink, acting as a recycling device for old books and writing implements. As such, it is capable of rapidly pulping, processing, and generating blank books from any written material input. It can also break down pencils and clipboards into raw materials for re-use. However, it was disabled shortly after Doctor Mobius left the Think Tank for the Forbidden Zone.",
    "If its personality back-up is recovered from Dr. Klein's house (House 101 in Higgs Village), the Book Chute reveals its personality to be that of a stereotypical jingoist censor.",
    "The Book Chute reacts with disbelief and fury to any mention of Communism, communists, or independent thought, and blames all problems it finds on traitorous activity, Chinese communist plots, or the like.",
    "The Book Chute converts old books into blank books, with each old book turned in yielding one blank book. The books that it will accept are as follows:",
    "These blank books can, in turn, be used at a workbench to create one skill book of each type. The player character will need to acquire the recipe holotape (which are single-use items) for the skill book they wish to assemble, as well as 25 blank books and two bottles of wonderglue.",
    "The mulching upgrade allows the Book Chute to breakdown any type of clipboard into one duct tape and one scrap metal. It can also breakdown pencils into five lead and one scrap metal for each turned in. The four clipboard types it accepts are:",
    "All My Friends Have Off Switches: The Book Chute is one of the appliances the Courier must upgrade.",
    "The Book Chute appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "The Book Chute's unique greeting after the player completes the Old World Blues main quest may not trigger and will never play."
