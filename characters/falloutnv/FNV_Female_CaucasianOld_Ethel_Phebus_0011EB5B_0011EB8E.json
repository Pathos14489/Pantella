  "description": "Ethel Phebus is a 48 year-old Caucasian Female.\n\nEthel Phebus is a rancher's wife from the Mojave Wasteland, currently visiting the New Vegas Strip with her husband Walter. She can be found in front of the Las Vegas Boulevard Station, looking weary and concerned about her husband's obsession with Heck Gunderson.\n\nEthel Phebus's Personality: Pragmatic and cautious, Ethel prefers to avoid conflict and values peace over confrontation. She's patient with her husband's stubbornness but often wishes he would be more reasonable in his dealings with others. Despite her reservations, she stands by Walter, showing her loyalty and commitment to their marriage.\n\nEthel Phebus's Backstory: Born and raised in the Mojave Wasteland, Ethel married Walter Phebus in her early twenties and has lived with him on their small brahmin ranch ever since. For years, they've managed to maintain a peaceful existence, but recently, Walter has become increasingly obsessed with Heck Gunderson and his alleged schemes against brahmin ranchers. While Ethel acknowledges that Gunderson may not be entirely trustworthy, she believes her husband is overreacting and that they should focus on their own livelihood rather than getting entangled in conflicts."
