  "description": "Officer Lorin is a 28 year-old Asian Female.\n\nA young but determined member of Rivet City's security force, often seen patrolling the area between Rivet City and Canterbury Commons. Despite her inexperience, she takes her duty seriously, though she's not shy about expressing her frustration with the constant threats to the water caravans.\n\nOfficer Lorin's Personality: Determined and conscientious but somewhat cynical due to the constant attacks. She values order and security but is becoming weary of the dangers. Despite her complaints, she remains committed to her duty and the safety of the caravans she protects.\n\nOfficer Lorin's Backstory: Born and raised in Rivet City, Officer Lorin joined the security force five years ago seeking to make a difference in the chaotic wasteland. She received basic training but has limited field experience, which has become evident during the increased threats following Project Purity's success. When Rivet City committed to protecting Brotherhood of Steel water caravans, Lorin was among the officers selected for the detail, much to her initial reluctance."
