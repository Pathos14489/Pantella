    "Paladin Bael is a Brotherhood of Steel paladin in charge of guarding the entrance to the Citadel in Fallout 3.",
    "Bael is an experienced fighter, but his conversational skills leave something to be desired. However, his commanding presence ensures that unwanted visitors stay well away from the Citadel's entrance.",
    "Although he is initially dismissive and hostile towards the Lone Wanderer and their abilities, as he would be towards any other wastelander, After the Battle of Project Purity, he ceases to guard the gate.",
    "Bael guards the Citadel's gate until Take it Back! is completed."
