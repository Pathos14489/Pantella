    "Stefan is a friendly glowing one in the CEO offices of the Red Racer factory in 2277.",
    "Stefan is the Surgeon's test subject, more politely referred to as an \"assistant.\" It took a considerable amount of trepanning (and radiation medicine) for Stefan to become docile and loyal. Stefan's job is to maul or cloak in radiation any intruder that intends to threaten his master, as well as the test subjects the Surgeon deems too unruly or not reacting properly with their implant chips. These are never referred to as \"mistakes\" though as the Surgeon doesn't make mistakes.",
    "Since the Surgeon \"reprogrammed\" its mind, it is non-hostile unless the Lone Wanderer kills its master. He is not affected by the \"Disable Chips\" instant-kill effect that can be triggered by two of the terminals in the area.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 After killing the Surgeon, Stefan will occasionally not turn hostile like he normally should. "
