    "Caesar, born Edward Sallow, is the leader, dictator and co-founder of Caesar's Legion in 2281. Under his command the Legion has been building up a presence in the Mojave Wasteland, fighting a prolonged war with the New California Republic for control of the region. He is a central character in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "By the events of the Fallout TV series in 2296, Caesar has been dead for some time, and his demise has led to a civil war within the Legion over his succession.",
    "Originally educated as an anthropologist, the man known as Caesar is feared as the most immediate existential threat facing the New California Republic. Inside the Legion, he is respected for his charisma, strategic mind, and unforgiving brutality. These traits are the main reason such a large, sprawling organization hasn't collapsed into a slurry of small, infighting factions.",
    "But despite the grand persona Caesar has created for himself, he also has a less graceful side. If confronted with his past mistakes, or if he feels that he is not in complete control of a situation, Caesar will reveal his true nature as that of a prideful, megalomaniacal bully with a fragile ego and a hair-trigger temper, and act out in petulant denial and anger or childish spite.",
    "Now in 2281, Caesar looms in his field base/headquarters at Fortification Hill, waiting to cross the Colorado River to avenge his humiliation at the First Battle of Hoover Dam and finally annex New Vegas as the capital he feels his empire truly deserves. Caesar is playing his cards more cautiously this time, and will not give the order for Lanius to attack the Dam until he can unearth the contents of the vault sealed beneath his base in the Mojave. Caesar also needs to neutralize House, attempt to forge an alliance with the Boomers, Great Khans, and the White Glove Society, as well as destroy the Mojave Brotherhood of Steel, and attempt to assassinate President Kimball. Two factors have halted his progress: firstly, a debilitating brain tumor that prevents him from fully administering to the day-to-day operations of the Legion, and secondly, his interest in reports of a resourceful courier whose ambiguous allegiance could either be a problem or, potentially, a boon to his efforts.",
    "Born in 2226",
    "In 2246, the twenty year old Sallow had developed into an experienced anthropologist and linguist. To have him benefit their cause, the Followers sent him east towards the Grand Canyon, on his first expedition. There are conflicting sources regarding the size of the Grand Canyon expedition party - in-universe, both Caesar himself and Joshua Graham indicate that the Followers sent only two, while according to behind-the-scenes sources, it was a nine-man expedition. While Sallow believed the tribe did this for ransom, Graham would later attribute the change in the tribe's relationship with the party to a mistranslation.",
    "The tribe was a sorry sight, weak and insignificant.",
    "The Kaibabs promptly surrendered rather than suffer the same fate, then the Fredonians, then all the remaining tribes. Caesar was acutely aware that the root cause of all the problems was tribal identities, leading to internecine conflict and preventing any substantial recovery. He knew what had to be done. He had to erase all traces of tribal identities and replace them with a single, monolithic culture. A year later, in 2247,",
    "He soon began putting his words into practice. Calhoun was sent away to the NCR as a messenger, and to warn them against interfering with Caesar's plans. While Calhoun was sent back to the Followers to inform them of what he was doing, the other seven members of the expedition were murdered on the self-proclaimed Emperor's orders. The newly-christened Caesar formed his Legion out of the tribes that had either been conquered or had chosen to capitulate to avoid total destruction. Joshua Graham would, however, ingrain himself in the Legion as Caesar's right-hand man and became the Legion's first Legatus, in time becoming known as the Malpais Legate. New Mexico and southeastern Utah, and became known as the \"Conqueror of the 86 Tribes,\" whose Legion had never met any serious defeat until their confrontation with the NCR at the First Battle of Hoover Dam.",
    "The Republic has the dubious distinction of being recognized by Caesar as a worthy adversary and conflict with the NCR was inevitable. For Caesar, this was more than animosity or petty hatred. He sees himself as Caesar returning from his conquest of Gaul and the NCR as the corrupt Roman Senate. A textbook example of Hegelian dialectics, where the thesis and antithesis conflict, creating a synthesis when the conflict is resolved.",
    "Of course, the New California Republic was not willing to roll over and surrender. Following a series of skirmishes and smaller battles (including the destruction of Fort Aradesh out east), the Legion forced a confrontation. In 2277, the Legion faced the NCR at Hoover Dam, in what became known as the First Battle of Hoover Dam. Discovered by Ulysses, a frumentarius, the Dam was a symbolic Rubicon. At the time, Caesar's 68 reformed tribes under the command of the Joshua Graham marched against the NCR garrison at Hoover Dam, in an attempt to take the strategic asset and river crossing. However, Graham's elite troops were drawn into a trap laid by Chief Hanlon of the New California Republic Rangers. As General Lee Oliver's soldiers held the line, Rangers and Army sharpshooters targeted their commanders (primarily centurions and decanii), sowing chaos among the common legionaries. The Legate, unable to adapt to new strategies in combat, ordered his elite forces to punch through and pursue Rangers decimating his officers, the Rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters executed a tactical retreat into Boulder City. Elements of the Army and Rangers kept the Legion engaged long enough to allow the most experienced legionaries to enter the city. When they did, the Republic's forces pulled out of the city. Once most of them were safe (soldiers and rangers trapped behind Legion lines had to be abandoned), they triggered explosives packed into the buildings in advance.",
    "Chief Hanlon's plan went off without a hitch. The exploding buildings acted as giant fragmentation bombs, killing and maiming most of the legionaries and leaving the rest in a state of shock; effectively crippling their offensive. The Army and Rangers followed the detonation with a counter-attack, pushing back and eventually routing the Legion forces and forcing the Malpais Legate to retreat from the dam back to the east of the Colorado River. Flanking attacks at Camp Golf and other camps in the Mojave were similarly repulsed.",
    "Graham was replaced by Legate Lanius, who embarked on a campaign of expansion eastward to subjugate further tribes for the Legion and gather forces for another confrontation with the Republic.",
    "Sometime between 2281 and 2296, Edward Sallow died from unknown causes. Before his passing, he wrote down the name of his successor as the Legion's leader and kept it with him by the time of his death.",
    "Before this information could be revealed, rivalries within the Legion, previously kept in check by Sallow's leadership, escalated to the point of fragmenting the once unified army, with at least two different men declaring themselves the new Caesar. By 2296, the decayed skeleton of Edward lies on top of a dirt mound dividing the central camp of the quarreling Legion factions, still holding the paper naming his heir; both sides violently prevent the other from approaching it and revealing the name to preserve their power.",
    "The bedrock of Caesar's philosophy is that service to the state is not just the highest virtue, it is the only virtue. Caesar is critical of NCR society as its leaders care not for the \"greater good\". This is contrary to Caesar's belief that \"an individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production.\" He views the Great War of 2077 as a chance for humanity to start over and aims to unify humanity under one banner or eliminate them should they refuse. Reading through old world books, Caesar has gained knowledge of the old glory of Imperial Rome and has used the ignorance of his followers to claim that he is Caesar, the son of Mars, the God of War, and not Edward Sallow, former Follower of the Apocalypse.",
    "Aside from total military defeat, Caesar's greatest fear is being exposed as a fraud. Most members of the Legion, excluding some of the most trusted ones, are oblivious to the fact that the Legion's culture is based on books about ancient Rome – they believe that all of the customs enforced by Caesar were dictated to him by Mars himself. Those who claim otherwise are viewed as ultimate blasphemes and are likely to be executed. While some of the newly captured slaves are skeptical, they don't tend to be vocal about it, and their children are taken away from their parents to be raised by Caesar's priestesses.",
    "Caesar regards the NCR as only an extension of the corruption that existed during the Old World and that it is ultimately doomed to repeat the same mistakes. He sees in it similar attributes associated with the Roman Republic before Julius Caesar seized power; extensive bureaucracy, corruption, senatorial infighting and filled with a people driven solely by greed and personal gain. It exists as the antithesis to the Legion and as a catalyst for change that only a confrontation with it can bring; a clash he sees as an inevitable product of Hegelian dialectics. The conflict is a vital one, not only for the future of his Legion strategically but also philosophically; the NCR is the first of his enemies to which he is truly ideologically opposed and the first that can truly test the strength of his Legion, as well as his philosophy.",
    "In his view, the NCR does not have a long-term solution to the problems of the Wasteland - the bombs had reset humanity's progress and he believed the time had come to rebuild it into something new.",
    "Caesar also regards self-sacrifice as a necessary part of rebuilding civilization, as evidenced by the fact that he refuses the very notion of using the Securitrons hidden inside the bunker underneath his camp. Caesar rejects allowing his Legion to advance technologically, believing that life must be kept hard and filled with sacrifice in order to strengthen humanity. so most legionaries must make do with tribal remedies, like the previously mentioned healing powder or bitter drink pilfered from the Twin Mothers tribe, all with the caveat that the pain remains.",
    "According to the ex-slave of a Centurion, Caesar is against homosexuality. As a result, homosexuality is punishable by death within his organization.",
    "If the player character manages to kill Caesar, the effects on the game are fairly minor, although the Legion ending is largely changed, due to the fact that Caesar, as the leader of the Legion, no longer directly participates in the events.",
    "Caesar appears in Fallout: New Vegas and is mentioned in the add-ons Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road. His skeletal remains appear in the Fallout TV series. Caesar is also mentioned in Fallout: The Roleplaying Game and appears in Fallout cross-over decks for Magic: The Gathering. He was going to appear in Van Buren, the canceled Fallout 3 by Black Isle Studios.",
    "Both are men of intelligence and education who traveled from a life of relative comfort, technological wizardry, and \"civilization\" into a wilderness full of warring people with relatively low education and a relatively \"primitive\" lifestyle. Both rose to power and were essentially deified for their intelligence, knowledge and leadership capabilities. Both cut off communication with the outside world and lived in their (until now) remote, savage kingdoms, using the most brutal means possible to deal with rare instances of dissent. Both have an \"unusual\" way of looking at the world due to their cultural isolation.",
