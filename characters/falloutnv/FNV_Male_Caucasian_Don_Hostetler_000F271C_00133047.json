    "Despite his wife's belief in him as a hard worker and family man, in secret Don is far from squeaky clean: he has been carrying out an affair with his secretary, Angie Beckers and covers for it with his long work hours.",
    "Aba Daba Honeymoon: After taking over for the injured Anders, the Courier is sent by Diane to deliver drug shipments for the Great Khans, including paying a visit to Don with a mildly suspicious package."
