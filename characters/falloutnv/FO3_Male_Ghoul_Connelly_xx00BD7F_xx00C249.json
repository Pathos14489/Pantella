    "Connelly is a ghoul found dead inside of the Old Olney underground in Fallout 3.",
    "A friend of Sanders, Connelly disagreed with the plans to head north and resettle away from humans. He wanted to link up with Roy Phillips at Warrington station, as he believed the northern wastes to be far too dangerous. Ultimately, he followed Sanders and the other ghouls, who together reached Old Olney, an empty ruin of a town. The ghouls settled in an underground camp, with Connelly erecting makeshift barricades to keep the local wildlife at bay.",
    "These were designed to keep mole rats out and did not protect the camp from a deathclaw attack that occurred just as the Lone Wanderer approached.",
    "Connelly's last words as a deathclaw ripped him apart were \"I told you so!\"",
    "Connelly appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel."
