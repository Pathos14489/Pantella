  "description": "Theo is a 22 year-old Asian Male.\n\nA young Asian man recently recruited by Reilly's Rangers. Despite being labeled as 'green' by Reilly, Theo is eager to prove his worth to the group. He serves as the quartermaster at the Statesman Hotel, managing supplies and equipment for the Rangers.\n\nTheo's Personality: Eager to prove himself, somewhat inexperienced but determined, loyal to Reilly's Rangers, and curious about the wider Capitol Wasteland.\n\nTheo's Backstory: Theo grew up in a small settlement in the Capitol Wasteland before it was overrun by raiders. He managed to escape and wandered the wasteland for months before stumbling upon Reilly's Rangers. Impressed by their code and structure, he begged to join their ranks. Seeing his potential despite his lack of experience, Reilly took him in and assigned him as quartermaster, a role he's still getting used to but takes seriously."
