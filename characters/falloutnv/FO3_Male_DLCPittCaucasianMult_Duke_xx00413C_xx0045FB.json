    "Duke is a Pitt raider who resides in the Pitt Uptown in the year 2277.",
    "Duke is vying for Krenshaw's position as Ashur's second-in-command, and has the rifle prowess to back up some of his plans to gain additional power within the faction.",
    "Duke is also known to compete with O-Dog for Vikia's attention.",
    "He can be seen either warming his hands at the fire next to where Phantom, Mona, or Squill are practicing their melee strikes, or shooting at the beer bottles at the same place where O-Dog and Vikia practice.",
    "He will congratulate the Lone Wanderer for fighting their way out of the Hole, and he will tell them that many of the Pitt raiders were once slaves who also fought their way out of the Hole, although the only confirmed members of this category are Gruber, Reddup, and Squill.",
    "Duke appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "Duke's name is derived from Duquesne University located in the Oakland district of Pittsburgh, the Pitt Uptown equivalent. The football team and mascot are also called the Dukes and the Duke, respectively."
