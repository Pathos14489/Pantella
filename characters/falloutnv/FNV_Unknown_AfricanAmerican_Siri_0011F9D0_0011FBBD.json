    "Siri is a Legion slave living at the Fort in 2281.",
    "From a small settlement in New Mexico, Siri was enslaved in a Legion raid. As a slave, she has seen first hand what the Legion does to those who try to run away. This fear has kept her from trying.",
    "Powder to the People: When talking to her, the player character can gain some XP and Legion fame by passing a Survival check of 20 in which they help her improve upon her recipe for creating healing powder.",
    "PC Siri may disappear from the game for no apparent reason. A possible fix for this bug may be to use the console commands prid 11fbbd, disable, enable, resurrect and moveto player, in that order. This will revive Siri and place her where you are, allowing you to talk to her.",
