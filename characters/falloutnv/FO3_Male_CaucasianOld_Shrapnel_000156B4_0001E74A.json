    "Shrapnel is a merchant who lives in Rivet City with his partner Flak. Together, they run the Flak 'N Shrapnel's weapons store in the Rivet City market in Fallout 3.",
    "Together with Flak, he is an example of the representation of LGBT people in the series.",
    "Shrapnel is a former raider whose edge never dulled. He is a grizzled veteran of the wastelands and quite coarse in his interactions. Ever since settling in Rivet City with Flak, he has focused on selling weapons and ammunition. He gets along well with Flak thanks to their shared interest in guns, to the point of being almost polite, but he has a hard time toning down his attitude towards other denizens of the ship. He is making an effort to be more polite, at Flak's request.",
    "Shrapnel is an alcoholic. The gun trade brings in enough money to allow him frequent visits the Muddy Rudder,",
    "Like Flak, he prefers not to talk about their past, keeping their violent history under wraps.",
    "Shrapnel is on decent terms with the rest of the denizens. He is almost friendly with Brock, almost polite with Vera Weatherly,",
    "Shrapnel has a complex daily schedule, with some packages overlapping:",
    "Things change if Flak is dead:"
