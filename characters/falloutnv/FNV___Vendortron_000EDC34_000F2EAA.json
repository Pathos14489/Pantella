    "Vendortron is a Protectron robot in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Located at the Gun Runners kiosk outside of Freeside, Vendortron, befitting its name, serves as the primary vendor for the weapons and ammunition produced and sold by the Gun Runners. According to the Vendortron itself, the kiosk was built around it in order to deter theft and assault. As such, it is impossible to kill Vendortron or pickpocket it.",
    "The store has five inventory tiers (the inventory is random and may not include all weapons listed below):",
    "Finishing the Honest Hearts add-on will also make the .45 Auto pistol, .45 Auto submachine gun, war club, yao guai gauntlet, tomahawk, and fire bomb available for purchase. Similarly, after completing Lonesome Road, rockets and nails will be sold. Sometimes, however, rockets and nails can be purchased before even starting Lonesome Road.",
    "On a terminal inside the Gun Runners factory, it is suggested that the Vendortron's name be changed from Vendortron to an actual name \"like Bob. We're not calling it Bob\" which is a reference to the 2000 post-apocalyptic science fiction film Titan A.E."
