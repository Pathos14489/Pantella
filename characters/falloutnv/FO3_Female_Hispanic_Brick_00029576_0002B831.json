    "Brick is the heavy weapons specialist in the Reilly's Rangers mercenary group in Fallout 3.",
    "Born around 2253, the 24 year old Brick was hired by Reilly as a heavy weapons specialist. Together with her minigun, Eugene, the muscle-bound gunner",
    "Brick gets along fine with most of the Rangers. She sees them as eggheads, with more skill in sciences and such, than combat, which is fine by her. She just points, shoots, and makes anything that gets in the Rangers' way die.",
    "Brick has a peculiar relationship with Eugene, or rather, Euegenes, as she has multiple miniguns sharing the same name.",
    "While Brick might be suffering from some form of personality disorder, it is equally possible that she simply enjoys the gore and destruction, and plays it up. If asked about whether she is \"certifiably insane,\" she is quick to joke that she killed the last person who said that, and asks Eugene for an opinion.",
    "Brick appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "The game guide gives Brick's age as 32,"
