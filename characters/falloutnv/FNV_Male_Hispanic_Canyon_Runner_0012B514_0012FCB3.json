    "Canyon Runner is a slave-master in Caesar's Legion stationed at Cottonwood Cove in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Once a member of the Blackfoot tribe, the first to follow Caesar as the foundation of his Legion, Canyon Runner served and climbed the ranks until he became a slavemaster, specializing in breaking those captured by the Legion and turning them into obedient slaves. He is a zealous follower of Caesar and firmly believes that conquering and enslaving people is the only way to save them from themselves by giving them purpose and virtue.",
    "If asked, he elaborates on the value of Cottonwood Cove as a staging area for Legion raids overseen by the commanding centurion Aurelius, and as such, the breaking of slaves does not occur there, so all he can do is assess the fitness of captures before they are sent over the Colorado",
    "By 2281, Canyon Runner is disappointed over the latest group of captures, members of the Weathers family (minus the patriarch Frank who escaped), finding them particularly problematic as not only are they poor candidates for slavery, with the exception of the daughter, but the matron also has a tendency to talk back. He would much rather sell them off for caps, but a lack of offers means he has to keep them penned up until they can be shipped out.",
    "Canyon Runner can be found inside the Cottonwood Cove storage or patrolling the area around the building, close to the cage where the Weathers family members are kept.",
    "Shane Johnson voices Canyon Runner and Oscar Velasco in a distinct manner. Both frequently do not pause in between sentences occasionally.",
