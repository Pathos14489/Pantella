    "The ant researcher is a dead scientist found at Shalebridge in Fallout 3.",
    "The researcher evidently had a deep interest in ants, leading him to explore the Shalebridge ant colonies. Unfortunately, he seems to have underestimated them: while the smaller forager ants ignored him, the aggressive, enemy colony did not and he suffered the lethal consequences, winding up dead in a small, stagnant pool inside the colony's egg chamber.",
    "The researcher carries a Big Book of Science."
