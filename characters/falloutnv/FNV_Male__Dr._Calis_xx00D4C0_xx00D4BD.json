    "Doctor Calis was the chief scientist and director of the X-13 research facility under the command of Big MT's project leads.",
    "Dr. Calis was the chief scientist in charge of the X-13 research facility under the command of Doctor 0 in Big MT. Much to the annoyance of his subordinates, Calis had a tendency to become furious over even minor concerns and had a no-nonsense work ethic in the lab.",
    "He asked Captain Hamm, the facility's security chief, to provide a shipment of cattle prods in order to control the night stalkers, who were becoming increasingly aggressive. His skeleton, still clad in a lab uniform, can be found sprawled on the ground outside the night stalkers' den.",
    "Dr. Calis was survived by evidently no one and recalled with scorn by his colleagues, whose negative comments can be found on terminals scattered around the facility.",
    "When asked why he created the night stalkers, Dr. Borous states that Calis dared him to splice together mountain lions, eagles and condors, which somehow lead to a combination of coyotes and rattlesnakes.",
    "Dr. Calis' skeleton appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues."
