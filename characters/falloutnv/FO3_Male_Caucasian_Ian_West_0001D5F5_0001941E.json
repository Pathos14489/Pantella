    "Ian West is a resident of Arefu and a member of the Family in 2277.",
    "He has an older sister, Lucy, who is a decade older than him, and she would lend an ear whenever he needed to talk about his feelings. Their parents were killed and Vance crossed paths with Ian, who felt a kinship with Ian. Ian was left alone in Arefu as the settlement's only child when Lucy moved to Megaton, causing Ian to become depressed. Ian was taken by Vance back to The Family's home. Ian now wonders what he should do for the future. Another member of the Family, Justin, feels a close bond with Ian and it almost borders on love.",
    "Ian West lived with his parents in Arefu for many years with a strange condition that caused him to have a hunger for human flesh. He claims that this condition may have been caused when he hit his head when he was younger. Ian states that he and Lucy were playing outside, when a scavenger started harassing the brahmin outside of Arefu. When Ian went to warn him to stop, the scavenger shoved him aside, causing Ian to hit his head on a rock. Ian then jumped up and tore the scavenger's throat open with his teeth before his sister Lucy pulled him off The Family were attacking at this point, and so the act was witnessed by their leader, Vance. Subsequently, the Family took him in and tried to convince him that he was not a monster. Disturbed by his strange hunger for human flesh, Ian goes under the guidance of Vance."
