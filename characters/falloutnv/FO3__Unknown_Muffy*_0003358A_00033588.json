  "description": "Muffy is a 3 year-old Terrier Mix Female.\n\nA friendly family dog that belonged to the McClellan family. Muffy can be found deceased in the backyard of their Georgetown North townhome.\n\nMuffy's Personality: Friendly and loyal, typical of a family pet. Despite being deceased, Muffy's remains show signs of a well-cared-for animal.\n\nMuffy's Backstory: Muffy was a beloved family pet of the McClellan family before the Great War. When the bombs fell on October 23rd, 2077, she was in the backyard of their townhome. Unfortunately, she didn't survive the initial blast or the subsequent radiation. Her remains serve as a sad reminder of the lives lost in the destruction of Georgetown North."
