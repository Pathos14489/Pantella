    "Frank Weathers is a former farmer and refugee living in the Aerotech Office Park in 2281.",
    "A former farmer hailing from Junktown, where he owned over 100 acres (0.4 square kilometers),",
    "This frustration, coupled with him eventually losing his job, caused him to abuse his family, beating his wife and children for the slightest problem. His drinking problem compounded the issues to the point that he was forced to seek help from the Followers of the Apocalypse at the Old Mormon Fort, getting kicked out in the process.",
    "As of his residence in Aerotech, his personality still reflects the same abuser who drove his family off.",
    "After completing Left My Heart, the Courier can make him commit suicide through a Speech check (35). However, if they complete Left My Heart without talking to Frank, he can't be spoken to afterward."
