    "Norton is a mercenary found outside Jacobstown in 2281. He appears once Guess Who I Saw Today is started and the Courier speaks with Marcus.",
    "Hailing from NCR territory, Norton has built up a repeat customer base and has been hired several times by political elements in the NCR as part of an effort to protect important assets in NCR territory, typically those that are appealing to special interest groups.",
    "Norton, like most mercenaries, isn't very loyal to those that hire him, only their caps. While he won't give up the names of employers,",
    "While an experienced and cautious merc, He also frequently uses \"Mutie\" as an insult, showing how much respect, that is lack thereof, he gives to any number of super mutants.",
    "Unfriendly Persuasion: Norton and his gang of mercenaries are harassing Jacobstown and Marcus asks the Courier to deal with it, non-violently if possible."
