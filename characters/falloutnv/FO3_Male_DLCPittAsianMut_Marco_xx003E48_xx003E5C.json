Marco maintains a low profile while harboring a strong desire for freedom and justice for his fellow slaves.\n\nMarco's Backstory: Born into slavery in The Pitt, Marco has spent his entire life working in the Mill's harsh conditions. Despite his circumstances, he has developed a natural talent for machinery and engineering, becoming an expert in maintaining the Mill's equipment. Over the years, he has been secretly gathering resources and constructing improvised weaponry, aligning himself with the rebellion led by Midea and Wernher. He sees the rebellion as the only path to freedom for himself and his fellow slaves."
