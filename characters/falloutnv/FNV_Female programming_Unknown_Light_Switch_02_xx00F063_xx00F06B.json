    "Light Switch 02 is an artificial personality operating in the Sink in Big MT. It appears in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Both of the Sink's light switches were created by Doctor Mobius for research into the ability of lights to enhance human cognition, with successful results. While Light Switch 01's function was for increasing Intelligence, in contrast to Light Switch 01, whose personality is colder, repressed, and more clinical.",
    "Both light switches despise each other; Light Switch 02 views her counterpart as a boring \"tramp\" and a \"frigid little ice queen\" with a superiority complex just \"because her processors are bigger.\"",
    "When Doctor Mobius left the Think Tank for the Forbidden Zone, Doctor Klein removed all of the Sink appliances' personality tapes and threw them off the side of the Sink balcony, including that of Light Switch 02. Light Switch 02's cognitive lighting function was also lost, and would similarly require a backup in order to be restored.",
    "Light Switch 02 appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Travis Stout wrote Light Switch 02, in addition to all the other artificial personalities in the Sink.",
    "PC The \"Smart Light\" and \"Mood Light\" bonuses are applied to the player character only when one enters dialogue with the light switch and toggles the respective light. So, after the light is toggled, when the bonuses passes, just re-entering the Sink and be exposed to the light will not be enough to get the bonuses again. In this case, to regain the bonuses of the light already toggled, it is needed to first toggle any other type of light (even normal light or lights off will work) and then toggle to the desired light again."
