    "Tabitha is the nightkin leader of the State of Utobitha and dedicated radio host at Black Mountain in 2281.",
    "In the course of her travels following the Master's downfall, Tabitha found a Mister Handy designated Rhonda, who became her constant companion and aide. Tabitha herself was responsible for saving several super mutants from suffering at human hands, including Mean Sonofabitch back in New California.",
    "The mutants eventually settled at Black Mountain under the leadership of Marcus, relying on its irradiated state to keep others, especially humans, away. Although her Stealth Boy-induced schizophrenia had been kept stable by Rhonda's presence, the Mister Handy suffered catastrophic damage somehow at Black Mountain and went into hibernation mode.",
    "The situation only became worse and worse. As the nightkin and second-generation mutants clashed with Marcus' group of first-generation super mutants, he found himself unable to broker a peace as he was unable to reach Tabitha in the radio station. Rather than aggravate the conflict, Marcus left with his fellow first-gens to settle and found another community, the commune of Jacobstown, in 2279, though not before he attempted to permanently damage and deactivate the radio equipment.",
    "Raul Tejada was instrumental in the revival of Tabitha's radio broadcasts. The old ghoul mechanic from Mexico was captured by the nightkin when he came to check on the inactive radio transmitter but bargained his way into serving the State of Utobitha as a repairman for any and all needs, under the constant threat of execution. Of course, Raul was always able to cleverly convince Tabitha and \"Rhonda\" into delaying his death by 24 hours in order to have him fix up whatever was broken at the time.",
    "With Black Mountain Radio on the air again, Tabitha began broadcasting to the ears of anyone with a radio and started a 24/7 broadcast of anti-human propaganda. Unsurprisingly, this has fully worked against Tabitha's best efforts, and it is now common opinion among Mojave wastelanders that radio static would be a better listen than Black Mountain's current block of programming.",
    "Narrated by Neil",
    "Tabitha appears in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "Xbox 360 If the Courier follows the duo, they may run into an invisible nightkin that is hostile to the Courier, causing both Rhonda and Tabitha to become hostile as well."
