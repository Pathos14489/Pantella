    "Quincy, named as a NCR trooper in game, is a deceased trooper in the NCR Army in 2281.",
    "Quincy was stationed at Camp Forlorn Hope. He, Harry, and another unnamed trooper were sent out by Quartermaster Carl Mayes to get extra supplies from HELIOS One,",
    "¹ The distribution of armor is as follows: 1/6 chance of wearing regular NCR trooper armor and 5/6 chance of wearing \"injured\" NCR trooper armor.",
    "Quincy's appearance is unique. However, because his apparel is randomized, he may alternatively appear as missing or not missing certain limbs. This is an effect related to the trooper armor, not his base character."
