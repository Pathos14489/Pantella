    "Branchtender Cypress is a member of the Treeminders and one of Oasis' armed defenders in Fallout 3.",
    "Before he arrived in Oasis, Cypress was a wasteland adventurer for many years, where he made use of a missile launcher for at least some time.",
    "Although Cypress is extremely loyal to Birch's ideals, he does not like that Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel constantly argue about whether to share Oasis' gift with the wasteland, as their arguments make the rest of the Treeminders uncomfortable.",
    "When the Lone Wanderer arrives in Oasis, Cypress is welcoming towards them, provided that they don't do anything to offend the Treeminders.",
    "He can be normally found hanging out around the gate to the caves.",
    "Cypress is the common name for Cupressaceae, a family of trees. All of the human residents in Oasis have horticultural names."
