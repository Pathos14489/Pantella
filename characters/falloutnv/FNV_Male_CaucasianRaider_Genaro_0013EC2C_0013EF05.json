  "description": "Genaro is a 45 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA weathered food merchant operating in the harsh streets of Freeside. Genaro can typically be found near the north gate, where he sets up his modest cooking station and sells a variety of questionable but nourishing foodstuffs to the wasteland's desperate and hungry. His table displays his wares, which disappear once sold, forcing him to constantly restock through his mysterious network of helpers.\n\nGenaro's Personality: Cautious and secretive, Genaro is primarily concerned with making caps and keeping his business running. He's friendly enough with customers but becomes evasive when pressed about the origins of his ingredients, understanding that some knowledge might ruin an appetite. He's pragmatic and has learned to survive in Freeside by any means necessary.\n\nGenaro's Backstory: Genaro was once a chef in a pre-War restaurant, though he rarely speaks of his past. When the bombs fell, he used his culinary skills to survive in the ruins of Las Vegas. Over time, he developed a network of individuals who scavenge for ingredients in exchange for food or caps. This network allows him to operate his food business in Freeside, where he's learned to make the most of the wasteland's available resources. He's been in Freeside for over a decade, establishing himself as one of the few reliable sources of cooked food in the area."
