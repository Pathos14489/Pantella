    "Garza is a citizen of Rivet City and general laborer for Doctor Madison Li's science team in Fallout 3.",
    "Born around 2247, Garza is a physically imposing and very reserved man. His past is a mystery to others in Rivet City, and he refuses to talk about it with anyone. In fact, he would prefer not to talk at all, and tends to limit his speech to as few words as necessary.",
    "Garza claims to have had little purpose in his life before Doctor Madison Li helped him through a difficult time in his life.",
    "Garza spends his free time working out on the Rivet City flight deck.",
    "The following is Garza's intended daily schedule in Rivet City. His home room is on the ground floor of the Rivet City science lab, and he will try to stay there at any time that he does not have other activities in his schedule.",
    "Garza is the Spanish word for heron."
