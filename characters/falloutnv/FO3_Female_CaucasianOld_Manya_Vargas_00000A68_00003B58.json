    "Manya Vargas is a former caravaneer, an elderly resident of Megaton, and the wife of Nathan Vargas in Fallout 3.",
    "Born in Megaton,",
    "Manya is descended from one of the founders of Megaton, and one of the people most knowledgeable about the town's history.",
    "The Vargas family didn't stop at just increasing defense. After initially helping her father as a scavenger,",
    "Eventually, they both amassed enough caps to retire in relative comfort at Megaton.",
    "As a result of her provenance, Manya is a full citizen of Megaton, with a spartan, but permanent home, unlike most of the transients living in the common house. While other members denizens keep an eye out for strangers, Manya's decades on the caravan trail left her with the uncanny ability to spot a raider spy from a hundred meters, making her much more comfortable around strangers.",
    "Her beloved husband is  her biggest headache. Since they retired in Megaton, Nathan took it upon himself to be the Enclave's greatest (and only) advocate in the town after Enclave Radio came on the air, basically proselytizing on its behalf, while trying to scrounge up parts for his gunsmithing.",
    "She also struggles with what appears to be Nathan's senility: He routinely forgets to pick up items for her from Moira,",
    "Both Manya and her husband share their surname with Paladin Vargas, a member of the Lyons' Pride in the East Coast Brotherhood as well as Manny Vargas in Fallout: New Vegas. Their familial relationship, if any, is not known, though it is stated in the Wasteland Census that Paladin Vargas is of no relation to Nathaniel Vargas. It's likely that they are all a nod to Snake Vargas, one of the starting characters in Wasteland and a significant character in the lore of that franchise."
