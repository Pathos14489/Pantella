    "Caleb Smith is a runaway slave and member of the Abolitionists in the Capital Wasteland in 2277. He appears in Fallout 3.",
    "Born to enslaved parents in the Capital Wasteland around 2245,",
    "After escaping from his bondage, Caleb looked for a way to survive in the wasteland and found it by falling in with a band of raiders. The extent of his activities while in the gang are unclear, but when Caleb learned about Hannibal Hamlin's mission and the Temple of the Union, he abandoned the raider lifestyle and journeyed there to join Hannibal and fulfill his mission to free and unite slaves across the wasteland.",
    "Within the Abolitionists, Caleb was the first to become a follower of Hannibal and cemented his loyalty by offering his masonry skills to restore any stone structure his leader asked of him;",
    "Whether by training under the more battle-hardened members of the group or as a hold-over from his raider days, Caleb is skilled in and even prefers the use of melee weapons rather than firearms, though he proves willing to expand his repertoire by asking his fellow freedom fighter Simone Cameron for firearms training.",
    "Caleb can always be found at the Temple of the Union, working on a stone slab containing an old, faded inscription from the Lincoln Memorial that he's trying to restore.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer completes Head of State by helping the Abolitionists clear out the Lincoln Memorial so they can move in, he will relocate there and reside at his tent for the rest of the game.",
    "Although the Fallout 3 Official Game Guide suggests that Caleb is able to use both melee weapons and firearms, ambient conversation with Simone points out his inability to shoot.",
    "Like the other members of the Abolitionists, Caleb's name is a reference to a historical figure of the American Civil War, namely Caleb B. Smith, who served as U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of the Interior from 1861 to 1863."
