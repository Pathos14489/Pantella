  "description": "Caleb Smith is a 32 year-old African American Male.\n\nA former slave turned raider who found redemption as a follower of Hannibal Hamlin and the Abolitionist movement. A skilled stonemason with a preference for melee combat.\n\nCaleb Smith's Personality: Resilient and determined, Caleb carries the weight of his past but has found purpose in the abolitionist cause. He is loyal to Hannibal Hamlin and dedicated to restoring historical landmarks as symbols of freedom. Despite his raider past, he shows genuine remorse and a desire to atone for his previous actions.\n\nCaleb Smith's Backstory: Born to enslaved parents in the Capital Wasteland around 2245, Caleb experienced the harsh reality of slavery from a young age. He eventually escaped his bondage and survived in the wasteland by joining a band of raiders. During his time with the raiders, he developed combat skills, particularly with melee weapons. When he learned of Hannibal Hamlin's mission to free and unite slaves, he abandoned his raider lifestyle and journeyed to the Temple of the Union. There, he became one of Hannibal's first followers, cementing his loyalty by offering his masonry skills to restore historical structures. Though skilled in combat from his raider days, Caleb is willing to expand his abilities and has begun training with firearms under the guidance of fellow abolitionist Simone Cameron."
