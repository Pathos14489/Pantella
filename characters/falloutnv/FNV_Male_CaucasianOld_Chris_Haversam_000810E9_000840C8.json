    "Chris Haversam is an engineer living in the REPCONN test site in 2281.",
    "Chris Haversam grew up in Vault 34 and was assigned as the vault reactor engineer due to his technical aptitude (and preference for machines that don't shoot people, which made him a preferred pick over fellow engineers Houser and Mitchell.) He believed the radiation he would absorb from his many visits to the vault reactor would turn him into a ghoul, although most of the management dismissed his claims as neurotic.",
    "Eventually, his hair began falling out due to natural reasons, but Chris insisted he was becoming a ghoul due to radiation from the Vault reactor and subsequently left the Vault. The vault descended into chaos shortly after his departure, when the reactor became unstable and began leaking dangerous radiation, turning most of the residents into actual ghouls.",
    "Believing himself to be a ghoul, Haversam joined the Bright Brotherhood in 2279.",
    "Come Fly With Me: Chris sends the Courier to find Isotope-239 igniting agent and thrust control modules so the ghouls' rockets can take off.",
    "The player character can convince Chris that he is indeed human with a Speech check (50) or with the Black Widow perk, and the rest of the Bright Brotherhood needs to leave him behind. The Courier is given the choice to help him sabotage the rockets so the ghouls die in flight. Alternatively, they can convince Chris not to sabotage the rockets, and he will send them off with no hard feelings before heading for Novac."
