  "description": "Brailee Ewers is a 36 year-old Caucasian Female.\n\nA 36-year-old woman with a weathered face and tired eyes that suggest a life of hardship in the wasteland. Despite her rough exterior, she maintains a clean and orderly home in Arefu, which she considers her personal utopia. Her blonde hair is tied back in a simple bun, and she often wears a faded floral dress that has been meticulously mended multiple times.\n\nBrailee Ewers's Personality: Kind-hearted but simple, finding joy in the small things of life. Fiercely protective of her home and husband, viewing them as the only constants in a chaotic world. Her mental state is somewhat fragile, leading her to create a perfect, orderly world within her home as a coping mechanism. Easily confused by complex situations but possesses quiet determination when maintaining her household.\n\nBrailee Ewers's Backstory: Born and raised in the small settlement of Arefu before the Great War. Like many in the area, she lived a relatively simple life focused on community and survival. After the bombs fell, she and her husband, Ken, struggled to adapt to the harsh realities of the wasteland. Over time, Brailee's mental state began to deteriorate under the stress of survival, leading her to retreat into a world of order and cleanliness within their home."
