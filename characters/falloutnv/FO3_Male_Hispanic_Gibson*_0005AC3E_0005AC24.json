  "description": "Gibson Gibson is a 47 year-old Hispanic Male.\n\nA well-dressed Hispanic man in his late 40s, now lying dead in the Capitol Post office building with his head torn off. He wears a tailored suit that, despite being stained with blood and dirt, still shows signs of quality. His body is positioned in a way that suggests he was running from something when he was attacked.\n\nGibson Gibson's Personality: While alive, Gibson was cunning and ruthless, prioritizing his own survival above others. His evil nature is evident in the predatory way he carried himself, even in death.\n\nGibson Gibson's Backstory: Gibson was a member of the Gibson family in Minefield, known for their ruthless business practices and connections to slavers. He traveled to the Capital Wasteland to expand the family's operations, dealing in weapons and slaves. However, his activities attracted unwanted attention, and he was eventually ambushed and killed in the Capitol Post office building by unknown assailants, likely rivals or those seeking revenge for his crimes."
