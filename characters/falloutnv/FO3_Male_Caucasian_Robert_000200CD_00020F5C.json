    "Robert is a member of the Family as well as its sentry and doorman in Fallout 3, protecting the entrance to the service tunnel connected to the Meresti Metro station where they reside in the Capital Wasteland in 2277.",
    "Born in 2243,",
    "When Vance first came around to the idea of forming the Family, Robert was inspired by his teachings and decided to stay and protect his friend as a bodyguard, later extending his protection to those Vance considered part of the Family.",
    "Due to his duties as the doorman, Robert spends much time separated from the cultish elements of the Family infused by Vance and does not profess them as much, even remarking negatively on having to memorize and orally recite the gang's guiding rules at will.",
    "Robert stands behind a wall of sandbags within the Meresti Metro station, occasionally wandering the small area between the sandbags and the Family's headquarters.",
    "One may potentially fail Blood Ties if Robert is provoked into attacking along with the Family. After Ian West makes his decision, the Family and Arefu factions are merged, but Robert will remain hostile. If he is killed after this point, the quest will fail."
