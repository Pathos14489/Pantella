    "DT: 36 (Remnants power armor)",
    "Cannibal Johnson is a former soldier of the West Coast Enclave's Department of the Army, living as a hermit in a remote cave in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Back when he was just \"Johnson,\" he served as an Enclave soldier during the height of their power on the West Coast, operating as the marksman",
    "After the loss of Gannon Senior in an undisclosed incident during a mission, his squad banded together to help his widow and their son. As the junior Gannon grew up, he was told often by Johnson about what a good man his father was, and although an older Arcade still struggles with his ties to the Enclave as a whole, he always kept a close connection with the squad due to this.",
    "Although Johnson and the others managed to avoid getting caught in the destruction of the oil rig by the Chosen One in 2242, the resulting collapse of the Enclave's West Coast power base eventually culminated in a massive assault on the remaining forces at Navarro by the New California Republic. The squad, Arcade's mother, and a young Arcade were able to escape ahead of the assault but were subsequently targeted for execution by both the NCR Rangers and the Brotherhood of Steel, forcing them to flee south through the Core Region and hope to integrate into NCR civilization and keep their former ties buried.",
    "After many years of keeping under the NCR's radar, Johnson and the rest of the squad, the Enclave remnants, fled completely from the republic's territory and eventually settled in the frontier of the Mojave Wasteland; after an initial stay in a old vertibird refueling station to stash their equipment,",
    "In his solitude, Johnson often waxes fondly on some of his positive memories, such as times with an old drill instructor, Arch Dornan, remembering him as \"the meanest bastard ",
    "A Courier with an Intelligence attribute of 3 or below unlocks a unique dialogue option when first speaking to him and Johnson mentions \"the Reaper.\"",
