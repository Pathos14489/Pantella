    "Pronto is the owner of the Lock and Load weapons store working for the slavers at Paradise Falls in 2277.",
    "Rumored to be the son of old slaver, Pronto is the sole proprietor of the Lock and Load weapons store at Paradise Falls, taking over after the untimely death of the previous owner due to an apparent weapons mishap, or so claims Forty.",
    "This \"nice guy\" persona puts him at odds with the rest of the slavers, who supply him with only subpar weapons looted from their raids, while keeping the better loot for themselves.",
    "A poor selection of weapons to sell, coupled with the danger of being enslaved or hung from the sign at the entrance to Paradise Falls if he tries to protest or take the better loot by force, has driven Pronto to seek outside assistance to improve his store's stock.",
    "During the unmarked quest Economics of Violence, Pronto will ask the player to obtain twenty chinese assault rifles to improve his weapon stock.",
    "Pronto sells weapons, armor and clothing, consumables and ammunition, and has the ability to repair items. Upon completion of Economics of Violence, Pronto states that he will provide a 20% discount to the player; however, no such discount exists.",
    "Economics of Violence: One can expand Pronto's shop by giving him 20 Chinese assault rifles. In addition, he will gain a few more caps (around 400 instead of 150).",
    "Pronto has unused dialogue related to buying Railway rifle schematics. These topics are related to his used line where the player asks if he makes his own weapons:"
