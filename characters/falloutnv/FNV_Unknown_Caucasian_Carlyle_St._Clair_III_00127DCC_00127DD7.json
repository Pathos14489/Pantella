    "Carlyle St. Clair III is a character living in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Carlyle St. Clair III is the heir to an influential merchant house. St. Clair cut ties with his family and was completely ostracized for something he refuses to talk about.",
    "With his originally well-off lifestyle and near complete seclusion, he was a natural choice after weeks of scouting as the main course for Mortimer's banquet at the Ultra-Luxe. However, when Mortimer's men attempted to capture Carlyle, they failed and he escaped. Since the attempt, he hasn't slept or barely left the area around his house, ever wary that another attempt to kidnap him might be made."
