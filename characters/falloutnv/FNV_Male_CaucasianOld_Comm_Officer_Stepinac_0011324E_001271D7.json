  "description": "Stepinac is a 58 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA seasoned NCR Ranger Communications Officer currently in charge of Ranger Station Charlie while Commander Beaumont is away on patrol. Stepinac is vigilant about the station's supplies, particularly the excess medicine and first aid equipment recently received.\n\nStepinac's Personality: Disciplined, methodical, and fiercely loyal to the NCR hierarchy. Stepinac is cautious about involving civilians in military matters and prefers to follow established protocols rather than take initiative.\n\nStepinac's Backstory: Born in the NCR-controlled territory before the annexation of New Vegas, Stepinac enlisted in the Rangers in his early twenties. After showing aptitude for communications and maintaining equipment, he was assigned as a Communications Officer. Over three decades of service, he's developed a reputation for reliability and strict adherence to orders. His Croatian surname is a legacy from his great-grandparents who immigrated to California before the Great War."
