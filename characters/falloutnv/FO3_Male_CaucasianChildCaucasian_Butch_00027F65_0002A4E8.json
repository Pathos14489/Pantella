    "Butch DeLoria is a resident of Vault 101 as well as the leader and co-founder of the Tunnel Snakes gang. He is a possible companion of the Lone Wanderer in Fallout 3.",
    "Born and raised in Vault 101 all his life and being under the care of his mother Ellen, a notorious alcoholic who neglected to oversee her son's negative maturing, Butch has been forced to put on a mask as a boorish, overbearing bully to cover up his deep-seated feelings of inadequacy due to not knowing his father despite living in a Vault with a close-knit community.",
    "On July 13, 2268, when he was ten years old, He also attempted to strongarm the Wanderer into giving up the sweetroll they got from Lucy Palmer.",
    "Six years later, on August 3, 2274, on their way to take their G.O.A.T. exam, the Wanderer found Butch and the Tunnel Snakes in the midst of verbally harassing Amata,",
    "* Items will be replaced by a non-player switchblade and 10mm pistol, if no replacement weapons are left in Butch's inventory while he is a companion.",
    "Butch DeLoria appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter, and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "Playstation 3 Xbox 360 If the player character has Fawkes as a companion and enters the Muddy Rudder, Fawkes and Butch will instantly turn hostile towards each other."
