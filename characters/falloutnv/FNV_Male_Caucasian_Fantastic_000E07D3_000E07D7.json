    "Fantastic is a conman working at HELIOS One as a technician for the New California Republic in 2281. It is obvious that his technical expertise is severely lacking, and he is merely using the position as a way to fuel his chem addiction.",
    "An immature and egotistical con artist, Fantastic was recruited by the NCR as an external contractor through the Office of Science and Industry",
    "Since arriving at Helios One, Fantastic, due to his incompetence and self-centered attitude, has done nothing to repair Helios One. However, he's been instilling the belief among NCR personnel that he's essential to the operations at Helios One, to avoid being fired, so he can gain as much money from the NCR as possible to fuel his drug addiction.",
    "Even though Fantastic has accomplished very little in his time at Helios, he has properly identified a couple of problems that he has yet to fix, like the outside mirrors being aligned improperly. For months he has been working on a single console, assuming that the biggest console is the most important, which, unbeknownst to him, is the console for the Helios intercom system.",
    "He works in the control room alongside Ignacio Rivas. Ignacio is shown through dialogue to be far more knowledgeable about HELIOS One, but Fantastic manages the plant and doesn't listen to Ignacio's ideas. He continues to maintain the plant's output at \"one percent efficiency.\" This is advantageous for Rivas as he has been purposely keeping Fantastic - and by extension the NCR - in the dark in order to protect information about Helios One. If the plant is run inefficiently then its true purpose, ARCHIMEDES, can be safely kept secret from the NCR.",
    "Full of himself,",
    "This would make him a shrewd character to deal with, but Fantastic is fantastically bereft of intelligence, which exposes him as a fraud to anyone who has to spend even a couple of minutes around him. Other NCR soldiers and Ignacio Rivas have little respect for him. When asked to elaborate on his working environment, his explanation starts promisingly enough, noting \"that console there controls the main power grid,\" but soon devolves, ending with, \"that slot over there makes sparks when you put stuff in it.\" If told that he doesn't know what he's doing, he disagrees and insists that he knows exactly what he is doing, he just doesn't know what effect it will have.",
    "Fantastic is also a frequent drug user, solely using his position to further fuel his drug addiction. He often uses his drug addiction as a sympathy plea to guilt anyone calling him out.",
    "Fantastic was written by Eric Fenstermaker."
