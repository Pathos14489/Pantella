    "Bleak is a slave being held at Paradise Falls in Fallout 3.",
    "Bleak is a slave that continuously plans her escape from Paradise Falls, spending her days memorizing the slavers' patrols and routine in hopes of using it to her advantage. Ultimately, it rests upon her shoulders to carry out the breakout as she actively works towards it, and has both a sober mind and the will to escape.",
    "Bleak can be found at the Paradise Falls slave house for the entire day.",
    "Xbox 360 Despite any efforts to free Bleak or make her leave the compound (which include killing all the slavers in Paradise Falls), she may remain in the holding cell repeating phrases like \"I've got to get out of here\" and is seemingly unaware that she is no longer obstructed from leaving (this may sometimes occur if the Rescue from Paradise quest has already been completed).
