    "The Vault 34 dwellers are the last surviving non-ghoul residents of Vault 34, along with Horowitz, in 2281.",
    "These three unnamed dwellers were originally residents of Vault 34 before the reactor leak destroyed the Vault and mutated the other inhabitants. They are first mentioned on a terminal inside the Vault's reactor room, in a message titled \"SOS.\" After a bomb was planted in the Vault swimming pool, the doors of the lower level sealed, and these dwellers were trapped down there along with Horowitz. The message states that the writer is trapped with their family and a few others. They await someone to reroute control of the Vault so that they can escape, although this is a slim hope due to all of the feral ghouls and radiation.",
    "None of the survivors are armed.",
