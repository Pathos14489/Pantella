    "Freki is a dog residing in the Calvert Mansion in Point Lookout, acting as a companion of the ghoul Desmond Lockheart. He appears in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "For years, Desmond has had Freki and his other dog Geri, eventually training them to become his attack dogs. While Geri was the abused ward of a group of raiders before being saved by Desmond,",
    "At one point, the dogs chased off Nadine after she wandered too close to the mansion grounds, causing her to stay away when the Point Lookout tribals' latest assault commenced shortly before the Lone Wanderer's arrival on the Duchess Gambit.",
    "Along with Geri, Freki patrols the foyer and the stairs of the mansion.",
    "The game files reveal that Freki actually has Evil Karma whereas Geri has Neutral Karma, as well as Freki being level 3 compared to Geri's level 1.",
    "Freki appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "The names of Freki and Geri are a reference to Norse mythology. The Norse god Odin was often portrayed as having two wolf companions named Freki and Geri. Freki roughly translates to \"greedy,\" and Geri translates to \"ravenous.\""
