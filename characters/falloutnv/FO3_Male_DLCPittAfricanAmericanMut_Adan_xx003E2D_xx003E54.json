    "Adan is a philosophical slave worker in the Pitt in the year 2277.",
    "Unlike most of the other workers in downtown, Adan is content with the life he has been forced to live by Ashur's army. Although he would much rather be free, he has decided that attaining freedom is currently an impossibility and thinking about it would only make him more miserable.",
    "Adan spends his days in front of the entrance to the Mill, sawing away at a destroyed bus with his steel saw. This is all he does until the quest Free Labor, in which his body can be found at the same location, being killed during the chaos caused by the uprising.",
    "Adan will speak with the player character about philosophy and how it relates to his life as a slave.",
    "Adan's name is pronounced \"A-din.\"",
    "Adan appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt."
