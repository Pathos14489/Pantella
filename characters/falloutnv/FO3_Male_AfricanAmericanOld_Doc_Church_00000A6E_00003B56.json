    "Doc Church is a doctor who works in Megaton in the year 2277.",
    "Doc Church used to stay alive by trading his services to raiders and slavers before he moved to Megaton. At that point, the town had been without a doctor for years. It may be a \"rat infested hellhole\" as he calls it, but he also says that it is the least hellish place in which he has lived.",
    "As Megaton's only doctor, he has got a lot on his plate and does not appreciate people bothering him without good cause.",
    "Doc Church can be found at the Megaton clinic at any given time during the day."
