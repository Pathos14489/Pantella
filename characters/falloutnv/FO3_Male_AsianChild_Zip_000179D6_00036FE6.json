    "Ricky \"Zip\" is a nine-year-old boy in Little Lamplight in Fallout 3.",
    "Hyperactive and quickly-spoken, Zip's energy is put to use as one of Little Lamplight's scouts and scavengers, a role he utilizes to further fuel his Nuka-Cola addiction by claiming any Nuka-Cola he finds for himself.",
    "He asserts his offer is always available unless, according to him, he dies from drinking too much Nuka-Cola, but he brushes this concern off almost immediately as he reassures that everybody knows this outcome is impossible.",
    "As his addiction makes him jumpy, Mayor Maccready has prohibited Zip from carrying a gun around town, stemming from a past incident that now means he must forfeit his gun into lockdown each time he returns from scavenging.",
    "Zip's propensity for getting distracted during scavenging missions has led to Eclair mildly reprimanding him, as he has forgotten to bring him items like meat or kindling needed for cooking.",
    "Zip has theories over where his nickname originated from, including that it may be tied to zippers because he wears pants (though dismisses this as others wear pants), or that it stems from how fast he is due to what the other children have told him (which he also dismisses on the basis everyone else is just too slow).",
    "His theories extend to the \"big, scary monsters\" inhabiting Vault 87, which he can bet the Lone Wanderer is going to kill, but not before interjecting that they might eat the Lone Wanderer's face off first."
