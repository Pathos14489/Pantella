    "Belle Bonny is the owner of the Muddy Rudder in Rivet City in Fallout 3. Bonny rarely leaves her bar and keeps it open longer than most places, including the Weatherly Hotel. Only in the morning does it briefly close to give her a few hours of rest.",
    "Born around  2222, Belle Bonny is one of the oldest citizens of Rivet City. She arrived around 2247, setting up the Muddy Rudder, a place of no tabs",
    "While Bonny's bad attitude has earned her few fans, there is more to Bonny than meets the eye. Although she has her ear to the ground as a bar owner and bartender, she is tight-lipped about anything she hears and refuses to gossip and badmouth other people,",
    "The only thing that really sets her off is people coming into the Muddy Rudder and ordering swill like regular water. Bonny serves beer, whiskey, and even wine (although she thinks it is not a real man's drink),",
    "Belle Bonny does not admit to liking anyone, and considers Rivet City to be a place forever stuck in a river, full of assholes.",
    "She does not participate in social events, preferring to focus on running the bar,",
    "She does have a softer side: she took Trinnie in, providing her with a place to sleep and tolerating her alcoholism to a degree,",
    "Brock is perhaps the only genuine friend that Belle has, though she keeps him at arm's length and refuses to take business tips, even well-intentioned ones, like suggesting raising prices instead of giving drinks away practically for free."
