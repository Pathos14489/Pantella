    "Rick Lancer is a prisoner of the Fiends in Vault 3 in 2281.",
    "Part of a caravan heading into New Vegas, he along with the rest of the survivors (Carter, Dennis, and Rachael) were taken prisoner by the Fiends. They were taken to Vault 3 to be held for ransom, however, unbeknownst to the Fiends, anyone who would be willing to pay such a ransom died in the attack. Thankfully the Fiends' have not found this out, otherwise they would have just killed the rest of the prisoners. During their imprisonment, one of their own, Carter, managed to escape and explore the Vault before being captured and brought back to the holding cell. Although Carter would die in that pen, the password he hacked and the weapons he found were relayed to Rick."
