  "description": "Rick Lancer is a 28 year-old Hispanic Male.\n\nA resourceful Hispanic man in his late 20s, Rick Lancer bears the hardened look of someone who has survived the harsh realities of the wasteland. His clothes are worn but practical, with a few makeshift repairs visible. Despite his imprisonment, he maintains a determined posture, his eyes constantly scanning his surroundings for any opportunity.\n\nRick Lancer's Personality: Resourceful, cautious, and resilient. Rick is a natural survivor who thinks quickly under pressure. He values loyalty but understands the need for self-preservation in the wasteland. While generally good-natured, his time in the Mojave has made him somewhat distrustful of strangers.\n\nRick Lancer's Backstory: Born in the Hub, Rick grew up hearing stories of the legendary New Vegas and the opportunities it offered. As a young adult, he joined a caravan company, seeking adventure and fortune in the Mojave Wasteland. For years, he traveled between settlements, learning the ways of the wasteland and developing skills in survival and bartering. By 2281, he had saved enough to consider settling down, but fate had other plans when his caravan was attacked by the Fiends."
