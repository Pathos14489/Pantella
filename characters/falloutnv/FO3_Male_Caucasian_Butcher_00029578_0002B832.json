    "Butcher (real name Carl) is the Reilly's Rangers medic in Fallout 3.  He can be found with the rest of the team on the roof of the Statesman Hotel, waiting for Reilly to return. After completing the Reilly's Rangers quest, he and the other rangers can be found at the Ranger compound.",
    "Born in 2246 as Carl,",
    "By 2277, Butcher was a fixture of the Rangers, with an active, open-ended contract with Reilly, paid 70 caps per mission on top of any salvage he recovered. He also earned three merits and zero demerits, behind Brick (five to one), but ahead of Donovan (two to null). His professional relationship with Reilly changed shortly before the mission to Vernon Square. While he was always flirty with Reilly, she brushed it off as merc humor, until she realized it was not. The budding relationship boosted morale between them, despite Reilly's concern over it adversely affecting their relationship within the company.",
    "The next mission would put that to the test. Reilly opted to scout Vernon Square, both to gather salvage and to train Theo, a new ranger on a probationary contract. Butcher hoped to pick through the ruins of Our Lady of Hope Hospital to find more medical materials and supplies.",
    "Soon, he would discover that he had very little time for anything but survival. While the team was mapping Vernon Square, they were ambushed by an unusually large horde of super mutants, forcing them to retreat into the ruined hospital and fight a running battle across the street to the Statesman Hotel. For reasons unknown to the Rangers, the super mutants were particularly bloodthirsty and kept coming after them. Once in the hotel, the Rangers made a fighting retreat to the roof. Theo was mortally wounded in the fighting, with Butcher unable to save him.",
    "Butcher appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "In 2277, he is 31 according to Reilly's terminal."
