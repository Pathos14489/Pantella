    "Private Kowalski is an NCR private encountered in Boulder City in 2281.",
    "An enlisted soldier in the ranks of the New California Republic Army, normally stationed at Camp McCarran, Private Kowalski has recently received leave and plans to head home to see his family in California with a caravan, going through the 188 Trading Post. During a layover at the post, he decided to make his way to Boulder City, to pay his respects to his older brother, Donald, at the Boulder City Memorial. His brother sacrificed himself so that the rest of the unit could evacuate some of the wounded during the terminal stages of the First Battle of Hoover Dam."
