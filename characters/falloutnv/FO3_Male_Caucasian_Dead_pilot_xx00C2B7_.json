    "The dead pilot is a deceased aviator whose skeleton can be found at the jet crash site in Point Lookout in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "During the Great War, a U.S. Navy jet aircraft crashed in Point Lookout, ejecting its pilot, who got stuck in a tree some distance from the crash site, and was killed by the locals after losing his rifle. After the crash, a local soldier from the Turtledove Detention Camp removed the blackbox recording but was attacked and killed by the hostile inhabitants of Point Lookout.",
    "The dead pilot's skeleton appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "In the game files, there is an NPC record for the dead pilot. This NPC is only used as the blackbox recording's holotape voice NPC (an actor required by the G.E.C.K. in order for holotape dialogue to play)."
