    "\"10 of Spades\" is the youngest member of the NCR's First Recon Alpha Team, stationed at Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "10 of Spades was born on a farm west of the Mojave, trained to use a rifle since the age of three.",
    "10 of Spades' partner in the field is Corporal Betsy, a veteran sharpshooter who volunteered for the spot after everyone else refused to put their life in the hands of a new recruit.",
    "If asked about how to help Corporal Betsy, he will recommend Doctor Usanagi, who helped him with his stuttering.",
    "Upon completing the Driver Nephi portion of the Three-Card Bounty quest by claiming Nephi's bounty, Alpha Team moves to Camp Forlorn Hope to help with the Legion at Nelson. 10 of Spades can then be found in the Camp Forlorn Hope mess hall.",
    "If the player character makes fun of 10 of Spades about his stuttering, he will become agitated. However, it is possible to apologize to him, which will allow the player character to speak with him once more. This apology removes the option to again make fun of his stutter. Making fun of his stutter twice will make him angry, and he will not talk to the player character afterward.",
    "10 of Spades is one of the shortest characters in the game, similar to the height of legionaries.",
    "10 of Spades was designed by additional writer George Ziets, who also wrote for the other members of First Recon."
