    "Ike is the bartender of the Big Horn Saloon and the sole resident of Boulder City in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The archetypal bartender of a lonely town, Ike is the only remaining resident of Boulder City after much of it was destroyed during the First Battle of Hoover Dam in 2277.",
    "Around October 2281, Ike's business took another hit after the operations at Quarry Junction were interrupted by an infestation of deathclaws, halting production and consequently the workers' wage prospects. Despite the slim pickings, Ike has thus far remained beholden to his establishment, refusing to close his doors and move on."
