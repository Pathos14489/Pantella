    "Sergeant Bitter-Root is a First Recon sniper in the New California Republic Army in Fallout: New Vegas. He is currently stationed with the rest of his team at Camp McCarran in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Born to Great Khan parents, he experienced a traumatic childhood marked by neglect and abuse. His father, an alcoholic, engaged in sadistic acts, teaching Bitter-Root to shoot at age three by targeting New California Republic military personnel and civilians. His mother, a chem addict, attempted multiple times to sell him into slavery to fund her Jet addiction, contributing to his deep resentment toward his parents and the Khans.",
    "In 2278, the New California Republic Army, supported by First Recon sharpshooters, assaulted the Great Khans' encampment at Bitter Springs in retaliation for raids on NCR settlements. The attack resulted in heavy civilian casualties and became known as the Bitter Springs Massacre. Bitter-Root publicly claims to have no memory of the massacre or the deaths of his fellow Khans.",
    "However, he privately told Captain Dhatri (who later adopted him",
    "Despite the deaths of friends and family, Bitter-Root harbors no resentment toward the NCR. He views the massacre as the inevitable result of the Khans' decline into \"lazy, trumped-up raiders\" reliant on drug trafficking, which they also consumed.\nBitter-Root retains the Great Khans' rite of passage: a prospective adult is beaten in a ring for one minute; survivors choose their own name.",
    "Bitter-Root sought therapy from Doctor Usanagi at the New Vegas medical clinic during his time at Camp McCarran, which helped him process his trauma.",
    "As a First Recon sniper, Bitter-Root enjoys \"shooting folks who deserve it.\"",
    "Upon turning in Driver Nephi's head to Dhatri during Three-Card Bounty, he will send Alpha Team to Camp Forlorn Hope to assist in the ground war against Caesar's Legion in Nelson; Bitter-Root can then be found in the Camp Forlorn Hope barracks.",
    "While residing at Camp McCarran, Sergeant Bitter-Root is the only member of First Recon that actually lays down on a bed and sleeps at night; the others simply stand or sit around.",
    "Bitter-Root was designed by additional writer George Ziets, who also wrote for the other members of First Recon."
