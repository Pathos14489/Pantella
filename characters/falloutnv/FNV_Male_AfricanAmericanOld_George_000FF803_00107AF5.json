  "description": "George is a 65 year-old African American Male.\n\nGeorge is a weathered scavenger and gambler who operates near Nellis Air Force Base in the Mojave Wasteland. His income comes from two sources: placing high-stakes bets with travelers who dare to venture near the military base, and 'reclaiming' abandoned or forgotten goods from the dangerous surrounding areas. George is notorious for his double-or-nothing wagers where he bets that travelers cannot reach Nellis's gate and return alive.\n\nGeorge's Personality: George is cunning, opportunistic, and pragmatically amoral. He possesses a natural talent for reading people and exploiting their desperation. Despite his morally questionable profession, George maintains a strict code when it comes to his bets - he always honors his agreements and pays his debts promptly. He's charismatic enough to lure people into his wagers but not above using intimidation tactics when necessary.\n\nGeorge's Backstory: Before the Great War, George was a successful entrepreneur who lost everything when civilization collapsed. Forced to adapt to the wasteland's harsh realities, he developed skills in gambling and navigation, eventually focusing on the dangerous areas around Nellis Air Base. Over the decades, he's built a reputation as both a fearless scavenger and a cunning gambler. George has been operating in this region for over 30 years, establishing his small shack as a known, albeit risky, meeting point for travelers and fortune seekers."
