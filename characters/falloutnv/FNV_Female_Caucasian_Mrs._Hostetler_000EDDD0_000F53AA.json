    "Becky Hostetler and Don Hostetler's wife, living in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "The Hostetlers are an honest, hard-working family that sought the safety of New Vegas to get away from the Fiends, Jackals and other raider gangs that terrorize the city, although they are forced to deal with the hefty property taxes imposed by the NCR. The family has worked hard to secure their home, and are there to stay. While Becky struggles as a farmer day and night to ensure that there will always be food on the table, her husband, Don Hostetler, took a job as an accounts manager at the Crimson Caravan Company to provide a source of income for his family.",
    "Alice Hostetler, the sole daughter of the family never wanted to become part of those dreams. Thus, she drifted into North Vegas Square where she met Andy Scabb, a criminal claiming to help her escape the dump. In reality, he intends to use her father's association to the Crimson Caravan to rob the company and the Hostetler household, then skip town. This has made Alice's parents concerned about her wellbeing, confiding in Crandon and seeking help in keeping their daughter safe from her new acquaintances.",
    "Mrs. Hostetler was written by area designer Jorge Salgado, who also worked on the quest Someone to Watch Over Me.",
