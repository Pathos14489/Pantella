    "Senior Scribe Yearling is a member of the East Coast Brotherhood of Steel, assigned to the Order of the Quill. She is in charge of the Brotherhood garrison and forward operations center at Arlington Library in Fallout 3.",
    "Yearling is the Order of the Quill's field operative tasked with collecting pre-War books from the Capital Wasteland.",
    "However, Yearling and her team have reached an impasse in their search for written works in the library, with a majority of the books destroyed or hidden underneath the rubble of the ruins.",
    "Yearling prides herself on propriety, correcting the Lone Wanderer if they refer to her as \"lady,\" and stating that her title is instead \"scribe.\"",
    "Despite Yearling's fondness and dedication to cultivating written knowledge, this courtesy does not extend to writing equipment such as ink, which she regards as \"old stuff.\"",
    "She can be found in the front desk area of the Arlington Library, collecting valuable pre-War books for the Brotherhood of Steel."
