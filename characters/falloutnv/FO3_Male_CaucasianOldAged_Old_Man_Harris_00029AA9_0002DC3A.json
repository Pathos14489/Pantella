  "description": "Old Man Harris is a 75 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nAn elderly man living on the outskirts of Andale in a small, weathered shack. His face is lined with wrinkles, and his eyes show a lifetime of hardship and caution. Despite his age, he maintains a sharp awareness of his surroundings.\n\nOld Man Harris's Personality: Cautious and reserved, Old Man Harris is deeply concerned about the safety of outsiders in Andale. He appears weary and resigned to his situation, but possesses a quiet moral compass that surfaces when discussing the town's dark secrets.\n\nOld Man Harris's Backstory: Old Man Harris was born and raised in Andale, though he has always felt uneasy about the town's traditions. As he grew older, he became increasingly uncomfortable with the practices of the town's residents but lacked the courage to leave or openly oppose them. He now lives alone on the perimeter, hoping to maintain some distance from the community's darker activities while still being close enough to avoid suspicion."
