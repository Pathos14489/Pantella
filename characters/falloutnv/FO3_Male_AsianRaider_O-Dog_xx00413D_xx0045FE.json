    "O-Dog is a member of the Pitt raiders who is commonly seen walking around the courtyard of Haven in 2277.",
    "O-Dog has a unique view of the world, considering all individuals to be differing grades of \"meat.\"",
    "Being another competent user of precision firearms, O-Dog is infatuated with Vikia and competes with Duke to get her attention, though he is rarely successful.",
    "O-Dog spends a lot of time shooting at beer bottles on an opposite building with his .32 hunting rifle. He can also be found walking around Uptown.",
    "Due to the fact that he possesses strange meat and refers to the player and other humans as \"meat\" and \"sausage,\" it is implied that he is a cannibal.",
    "O-Dog appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "His name and proclivity for referring to people as meat products is a reference to Pittsburgh's landmark restaurant in Oakland (Uptown in game, where O-Dog is located), Essie's Original Hot Dog Shop (shortened simply to \"The O\" by locals). Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Essie's Original Hot Dog shop closed in April of 2020. Hot dogs that were served from \"The O\" were referred to simply as O-Dogs."
