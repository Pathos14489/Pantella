    "Oliver Swanick is a former member of the Powder Gangers and the only unscathed survivor of the massacre of Nipton carried out by Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Oliver Swanick was a former inmate of the NCR Correctional Facility when Samuel Cooke orchestrated a mass breakout, and he subsequently joined Eddie's newly-formed Powder Gangers in 2281. Swanick was among the Powder Gangers who were in Nipton on the day that Vulpes Inculta and the forces of the Legion captured the town's population, including the locals, the Powder Gangers, and members of the New California Republic Army. Vulpes then carried out a \"lottery\" where everyone received a ticket determining their fate, ranging from decapitation to immolation to enslavement. As the first place \"winner\" of the lottery, Swanick was the only person allowed to leave the town alive and unharmed,",
    "When first entering Nipton, Swanick will run toward the Courier and initiate conversation. He will approach regardless of which direction one enters, then run off upon ending the dialogue.",
    "When asked who came up with Oliver Swanick, Joshua Sawyer responded that he thought it was John Gonzalez."
