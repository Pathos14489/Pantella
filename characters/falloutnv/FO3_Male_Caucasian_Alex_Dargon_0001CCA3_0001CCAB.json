    "Alex Dargon is a botanist, and member of Doctor Madison Li's science team in Fallout 3. He is found at Project Purity after it's restored, then at The Citadel after The Waters of Life, and back at the purifier in the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel.",
    "Alex grew up in Rivet City and was always interested in what the scientists were doing there. Doctor Madison Li took him under her tutelage, and taught him everything he knows.",
    "After James returns to his former colleagues, almost twenty years after abandoning it and fleeing to Vault 101, Alex and Daniel Agincourt get the call to return from the field.",
    "His initial high spirits turn to fear and panic",
    "Provided that he survives the escape and makes it to the opposite side of the Potomac River, he and the others make their way to The Citadel (he is subsequently impressed by the Brotherhood's set up",
    "Two weeks after the battle, he can be found continuing his work at the project. Although the Brotherhood scribes are not the friendliest people he's worked with, he's been doing what he can to get along with them."
