    "Ranger Grant is an NCR Ranger coordinating security during President Kimball's visit and speech at Hoover Dam in 2281.",
    "Grant is a long time NCR ranger, best described as the \"shoot first, never ask questions\" type of soldier, someone who doesn't mind going into combat, so long as his soldiers shoot alongside him. He was injured at one point during his service. He also seems to enjoy (and even volunteer for) more dangerous missions.",
    "Despite wearing his eyepatch on his right eye, he takes aim using that eye. This is due to the aiming animation only being for right eye dominant characters."
