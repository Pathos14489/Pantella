    "Gloria Van Graff, or simply Glory by her half-brother, is the head of the Van Graff family in New Vegas and manager of the Silver Rush energy weapons store in 2281.",
    "Gloria is the ambitious daughter of the Van Graff matriarch, who has expanded her family's operations into the Mojave Wasteland (largely because she did not get along with her parents).",
    "Her general strategy is to maximize profits through official and unofficial deals, as well as undercutting the competition.",
    "Of course, Gloria has bigger ambitions. As the Legion was making entreaties towards traders in the Mojave, she contacted one of their representatives and agreed to provide them with energy weapons.",
    "Gloria is a passionate woman and has been known to have held intimate relationships with Kings member Pacer and with a former Van Graff employee Jacob. Both have ended on less than amicable terms. Other than those two relationships, Gloria has been known to sleep with many employees of the Van Graffs'; so much so that her mother has told her to not \"tip the help.\"",
    "Pacer's relationship with Gloria, while never mentioned in-depth, is reason enough for Pacer to nose around in the business of the Van Graffs. Pacer often harasses Simon during his shift, but an action like that could easily result in an easy and well-disguised political assassination.",
    "The other relationship with Jacob was as straight forward as could be with the power dynamic between manager and employee. Gloria had admitted to Jacob that she gets easily jealous and would only entertain the relationship if he stayed loyal to her. While Jacob promised to do so, he was later caught by Gloria at Gomorrah being serviced by one of their prostitutes.",
    "* See bugs.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 Gloria drops drained microfusion cells in place of drained small energy cells. This bug is present with every plasma pistol user, as the particular leveled list for equipping a non-player character with a plasma pistol and ammunition (WithAmmoPlasmaPistolLoot, to be precise) calls for microfusion cells in place of energy cells.
