    "Woodrose is one of the inhabitants of Point Lookout and the tribe mother of the local tribals in 2277.",
    "A timid and thoughtful girl, Woodrose recently blossomed when she joined the local tribals. Tending to a variety of hydroponic punga plants, she cultivates new and more delicious strains, in accordance with Jackson's wishes.",
    "She takes care of the tribals who cannot care for themselves after having part of their brain removed, helping them eat, sleep and with other essential tasks for living.",
    "When spoken to, Woodrose's dialogue comes off with a hostile tone toward the Lone Wanderer. This may be because they are not one of the tribals or she is simply stressed because of her tribal duties.",
    "Like the rest of the tribe, she will become hostile if Professor Calvert is killed during A Meeting of the Minds.",
    "Woodrose appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "The name \"Woodrose\" is a reference to \"Hawaiian Woodrose Seeds,\" a powerful natural hallucinogen. Similarly, Jimson, another tribe member, is a reference to \"Jimson Weed,\" another natural hallucinogen."
