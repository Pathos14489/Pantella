    "Head Scribe Lars Taggart is a member of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, residing within the Hidden Valley bunker in the Mojave Wasteland. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "While his position as head scribe indicates Taggart is meant to be the leading authority of all scribe activities in the bunker, including overseeing research, cataloging data and processing recovered technology, the man consistently neglects his duties according to his subordinate Senior Scribe Linda Schuler, forcing her to pick up the slack instead while remarking about how she is head scribe in all but rank;",
    "Taggart primarily spends his time fiddling with and coding new virtual reality simulations, leaving it available as a vulnerability.",
    "The character's name and personality are a nod to the character of \"James Taggart\" from the film Atlas Shrugged.",
    "Playstation 3 Xbox 360 He shares the same bug with Nolan McNamara, Hardin and Ibsen, saying \"Later\" the same way that Antony should."
