    "Mrs. McBain was the wife of Sheriff McBain and the sister of Deputy Beagle. She was murdered by escaped convicts in late October, 2281.",
    "The McBains were murdered by escaped convicts in their sleep together. This event was witnessed by Beagle who proceeded to spy on the convicts instead of anything else. Their decapitated corpses were left behind at the sheriff's office to rot. The townsfolk of Primm give them both a proper burial once peace is restored.",
    "Joshua Sawyer stated that while some naked corpses in the game could be seen as indicative of \"defilement,\" the McBains in particular are examples of where the naked bodies are used to represent that they were killed in their sleep."
