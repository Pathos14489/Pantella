    "Ranger Jackson is a member of the New California Republic's Rangers and serves as the commanding officer of the Mojave Outpost in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A principled patriot with an excellent grasp of strategy, Jackson was posted to the Mojave Outpost sometime prior to 2281 to ensure that caravans could safely arrive in the Mojave from New California and continue safely along Interstate 15 to New Vegas. However, by October 2281, recent complications on the I-15 including the breakout at the NCR Correctional Facility and the subsequent opposition by the Powder Gangers have frustrated him, as he cannot take any action without breaking his standing orders, but at the same time, those very standing orders prevent him from carrying out his standing orders. Left between a rock and a hard place, Jackson has taken to venting his frustrations to travelers in order to make the situation bearable in any way.",
    "The orders in question demand that he keep a standing force at the NCR perimeter at all times, with a force of fresh recruits for a garrison. To make things worse, in order to deal with the situation up north, he'd have to send soldiers out and that would reduce his standing force below acceptable levels.",
    "Although he cannot disobey his orders, Jackson is more than willing to work around them to fulfill his duties. He will admit that though he cannot outright contract mercenaries, he can turn the cheek to \"accidental\" misplacements of supplies while dealing with people willing to take on dangerous assignments to help fix his problems.",
    "This single-minded belief in justice and patriotism helps keep Jackson on the straight and narrow, especially when greed and corruption lead to unnecessary loss of life among honest caravaneers"
