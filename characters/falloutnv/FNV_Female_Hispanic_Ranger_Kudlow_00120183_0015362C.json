    "Ranger Kudlow is a member of the New California Republic Rangers and the lead officer stationed at Ranger Station Foxtrot in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. She appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "In her post to Ranger Station Foxtrot prior to 2281, Ranger Kudlow's primary mission has been observing the activities of the Great Khans inhabiting Red Rock Canyon to the south of the station.",
    "Kudlow also has a low opinion of Comm Officer Lenk, having little sympathy for her story of falling into gambling and alcohol to cope with trauma. She disapproves of Lenk's \"jumpy\" tendencies and its effect on group morale after she was assigned to Foxtrot as her last chance to remain a Ranger.",
    "The Courier may approach Ranger Kudlow and ask her about the outpost's mission and some details about her troops.",
    "The NCR Rangers at the ranger stations, including Kudlow, were written by additional area designer Matt MacLean, who worked on the quest Return to Sender."
