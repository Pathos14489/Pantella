    "Anders is a drug runner working for Diane and Jack of the Great Khans found crucified at Cottonwood Cove in 2281.",
    "Anders was originally sent out of Red Rock Canyon about three weeks before the Courier's arrival there, in order to find a route into Arizona, to open up a new market for the Khans' \"recreational\" goods. However, Anders was apprehended by members of the Caesar's Legion near Cottonwood Cove and promptly crucified for dealing in chems, as Caesar's law dictates.",
    "If the player character passes the Speech check with Jack for the quest Oh My Papa, therefore bypassing any need to complete any quests, asking Diane for work will cause her to ask for help finding Anders, who will still be on the cross."
