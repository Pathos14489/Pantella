    "Moe is a unique centaur residing on Black Mountain in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Like all centaurs found roaming the West Coast, the one known as \"Moe\" was created as an amalgamation of various organic parts by the Master and his modified use of the Forced Evolutionary Virus. Sometime in the latter 23rd century, after Black Mountain was resettled by an enclave of super mutants, State of Utobitha leader Tabitha had a pack of them including Moe corralled around an irradiated impact crater close to the peak.",
    "Sometime prior to October 2281, a pair of paladins from the Mojave Brotherhood of Steel, Fairbanks and Hughes, were sent to scout Black Mountain for Elder McNamara and look for parts from the pre-War radio equipment to bring back to the bunker at Hidden Valley. Due to the Brotherhood's outdated information on the mutants from when they were led by the more peaceful Marcus, the paladins underestimated the threat and ended up getting killed, with their bodies left to rot at the bottom of the crater surrounded by the centaurs.",
    "Still in the Dark",
    "If killed, Moe will respawn, usually taking three in-game days.",
    "PC Xbox 360 One can see through Moe's head when his face is blasted off. "
