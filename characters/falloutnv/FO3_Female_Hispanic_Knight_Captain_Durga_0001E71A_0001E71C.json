    "Knight Captain Durga is the Brotherhood of Steel quartermaster based out of the Citadel in Fallout 3.",
    "The Citadel's quartermaster, Knight Captain Durga is not entirely pleased with her position in the Brotherhood of Steel, and makes no attempt to hide it in her interactions.",
    "Regardless, she takes her role as quartermaster very seriously, and will adamantly refuse to trade with the Lone Wanderer without Elder Lyons' say-so, immediately ending the conversation and informing them of the elder's instructions forbidding trade with outsiders.",
    "Unlike most other denizens of the Citadel, she refrains from \"archaic\" language (the style of speech employed by Brotherhood of Steel members; such as Star Paladin Cross) in favor of more \"modern\" type speech (\"yeah,\" \"gotcha,\" etc.).",
    "She is located in the backroom of the armory in the Citadel laboratory. She never sleeps at any point of the day, even though a bed can clearly be seen behind her.",
    "One needs the permission of Elder Lyons to trade with her. After completing Take it Back!, this permission is no longer needed."
