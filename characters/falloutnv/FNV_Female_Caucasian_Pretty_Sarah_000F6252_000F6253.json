    "Pretty Sarah is the pimp of the Casa Madrid Apartments in Westside in 2281.",
    "Although it may seem odd for a woman to be pimping prostitutes, for Sarah it is just a way to earn money. The wasteland and the hardship she suffered made her tough as nails and capable of taking whatever comes her way.",
    "She is not deflective of her past; she downright avoids the topic, and for good reason."
