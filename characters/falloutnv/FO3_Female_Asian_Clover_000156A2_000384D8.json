    "Clover is a slave residing in Paradise Falls in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3. She is a possible companion of the Lone Wanderer.",
    "Originally captured a few months ago prior to the Lone Wanderer leaving Vault 101 in 2277, Clover and her fellow slave Crimson were systematically broken mentally by the torture and abuse perpetrated by the slavers of Paradise Falls until they became obedient to their captors. Eulogy Jones himself claimed both as his personal slaves, using them for sex, personal protection, and as stress relief while continuing to abuse them to no end.",
    "Clover's utter devotion to Eulogy Jones borders on the extreme; ready to fulfill his wishes at a moment's notice. Eulogy actually expects her to anticipate his desires before he even speaks of them and would subject her to verbal abuse whenever she failed to do so or even simply fell behind while following him.",
    "Due to the constant stream of abuse she has suffered, Clover is desperate for Eulogy's attention and whenever he's displeased, she immediately apologizes profusely, begging him to let her make up for it and assuming the blame no matter how minor it was.",
    "A corollary of her situation is that she is extremely jealous of Eulogy, particularly when Crimson is concerned. She regularly nags her \"daddy\" to sell his other slave off, so that he can be alone with her. These requests typically earn a berating from Jones with a reminder that Crimson is to be left alone, unless he says otherwise.",
    "Ironically, Eulogy's supposed \"favorite\" is the one he's most looking to sell off at a high price.",
    "Clover appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout Shelter Online.",
    "Xbox 360 Trading certain headgear to her will cause her to wear it, but when the player removes it from her inventory, it will become a \"default\" piece of gear. Other headgear may be given to her to replace it, and she will wear it as normal, but as soon as they remove said headgear from her, she will revert to the previous headgear. It has been confirmed with the stormchaser hat and eyeglasses. "
