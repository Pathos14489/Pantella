    "Tobar has various ports along the Atlantic Seaboard. His current career as a ferryman revolves around the punga fruit produced by the tribals from Point Lookout. The tribal leader of the fruit farmers has struck a gruesome bargain with the ferryman is permitted to export the considerable surplus of punga fruit produced by the commune every month, although Tobar is wary to reveal his supplier.",
