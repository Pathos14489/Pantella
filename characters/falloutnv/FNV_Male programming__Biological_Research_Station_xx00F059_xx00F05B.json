    "The GS-2000 Biological Research Station is an artificial personality in the Big MT in 2281.",
    "The Biological Research Station is part of a versatile automatic garden that allows for the growing and analysis of a variety of flora. With the ability to clone Its personality holotape somehow made its way to the X-22 botanical garden after Doctor Klein threw it off the Sink's balcony in anger.",
    "At some point before or during the Courier's time in Big MT, Muggy was tricked by the Biological Research Station into looking for a coffee mug inside its chassis, for which the mini Securitron was then \"seeded.\"",
    "The Biological Research Station will plant 11 types of seeds from the samples provided to it, which will sprout into plants, which can be harvested every 72 hours that pass in the Big MT. Conveniently, the plants are the same types that are able to be given to the Station in exchange for Salient Green on a 1 for 1 basis.",
    "The following types of plants are grown by, and can be exchanged for, Salient Green at the Biological Research Station:",
    "The Biological Research Station appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Travis Stout wrote the Biological Research Station, in addition to all the other artificial personalities in the Sink."
