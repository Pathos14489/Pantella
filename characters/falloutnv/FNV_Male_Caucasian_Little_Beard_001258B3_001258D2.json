  "description": "Little Beard is a 35 year-old Wastelander Male.\n\nA rugged gunslinger with a distinctive but smaller beard compared to his partner, Big Beard. He often lets Big Beard do the talking, especially when dealing with clients or collecting debts.\n\nLittle Beard's Personality: Quiet, observant, and loyal. He prefers action over words and trusts Big Beard's judgment in negotiations.\n\nLittle Beard's Backstory: Little Beard and his partner, Big Beard, have been working as guns-for-hire in the Mojave Wasteland for years. At some point prior to 2281, they incurred a debt to Carlitos Wayne related to an unknown incident involving their beards. Despite this debt, they continue to take on dangerous jobs, with Little Beard serving as the muscle while Big Beard handles the negotiations."
