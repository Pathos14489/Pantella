    "She spends much time alone in a corner of the slave house and laments that Rory Maclaren is in danger of dying due to being isolated in the Box for a long period. She has become fond of the man.",
    "Outside of her role as a child slave, Penny is a scavenger adept at foraging food and understanding wasteland animals. At Lamplight, she admires her brother Joseph and she aspires to be like him due to his resourcefulness and wisdom."
