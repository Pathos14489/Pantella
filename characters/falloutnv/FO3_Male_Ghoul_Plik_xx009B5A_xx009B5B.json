    "Plik is a ghoul inhabitant of Point Lookout in the year 2277.",
    "A jovial host of his prestigious hunting club for society's richest (or most bored) clientèle, Plik has witnessed the spread of feral ghouls in the area, and seeks to limit this encroachment while attempting an enterprising scheme in the process.",
    "Plik runs a little hunting club out of the coastal grotto, but it is \"strictly for high-rollers.\" It appears Plik has a scientific background and has taken extensive notes on the anatomy of feral ghouls, referenced in his journal which will grant the Ghoul Ecology perk upon reading.",
    "Plik appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "Plik and his safari were described by developer Joel Burgess as his \"pet project.\" Voice actor Jeff Baker, who also portrayed Desmond Lockheart, was originally supposed to voice Plik and put on a Southern accent; in the game files, Plik shares a voice type with Desmond. However, Plik's script never made its way into the voice recording session with Baker, and the mistake was not realized until long after the session was concluded. As such, Burgess simply recorded Plik's voiceover himself. Burgess self-deprecatingly joked that Plik's voiceover is him doing his \"best impression of Grover wishing he had Robitussin.\""
