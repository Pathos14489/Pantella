    "Breadbox is a slave in Paradise Falls in 2277.",
    "Breadbox is the oldest slave in the camp, having been enslaved for over 30 years.",
    "He lives in the adult pen with other enslaved individuals, including Jeanette, Bleak, and Bronson.",
    "Breadbox can be heard giving advice to Bronson, encouraging him to take care of himself, to think as optimistically as possible about his capture, and warning him that alcohol will not solve and only exacerbate his problems.",
    "Breadbox is a slave locked up in the Paradise Falls slave pen, and can be found there the entire day. If one is able to open the gate and free the other slaves, Breadbox is the only one that will not flee, making him the only slave that can only be found at the pens unless killed."
