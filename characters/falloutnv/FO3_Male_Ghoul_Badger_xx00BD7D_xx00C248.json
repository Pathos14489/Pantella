    "Badger is a ghoul who is found dead in the Old Olney underground in 2277.",
    "Badger was once a member of Underworld, but after coming to a series of disagreements with the settlement’s leaders, he decided to split off and lead a group comprised of Sanders and several others to find a new home. They eventually settled the Old Olney underground, where Badger was responsible for foraging food and supplies. While playing a game of pool in his new home, Badger was surprised and killed by a group of Deathclaws that were also living in the underground.",
