  "description": "Elena Ríos is a 45 year-old Hispanic Female.\n\nElena Ríos is a weathered yet skilled armorer for the Great Khans, with calloused hands and sharp eyes that have seen decades of hardship in the wasteland. Her workshop is a meticulously organized basement filled with weapon parts, tools, and a variety of firearms. Despite her tough exterior, she maintains a pragmatic and fair approach to trading with outsiders who have earned the tribe's trust.\n\nElena Ríos's Personality: Pragmatic, meticulous, and guarded but fair. Elena takes pride in her craftsmanship and values quality over quantity. She is skeptical of outsiders but respects those who honor their deals. She has a dry wit and a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to business, but she holds a soft spot for those who appreciate fine craftsmanship.\n\nElena Ríos's Backstory: Born to a family of survivors in the Great Khan tribe, Elena showed an early aptitude for weapon maintenance and modification. Her father, a respected armorer himself, taught her the trade when she was barely a teenager. As the tribe moved through the Mojave, Elena's skills became invaluable, and she eventually took over her father's role when his health declined. She has dedicated her life to ensuring the Great Khans have reliable weapons and ammunition, often spending hours perfecting modifications to suit the tribe's nomadic combat style."
