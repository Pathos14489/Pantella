    "Sister is a slaver found in Rivet City in Fallout 3.",
    "One of the least personable denizens of the City, the 29-year-old Sister is a beast of a man with an incredibly short fuse. Nobody knows where he got the nickname from, and even fewer manage to walk away if they make the mistake of asking him about it. Despite numerous altercations with other citizens, he managed to avoid getting thrown off by Harkness and Lana Danvers.",
    "Sister is well-known among the citizens of Rivet City as a murderous sociopath",
    "Sister has been looking for it for a while, but the trail has gone cold. Most of his fellow slavers think that Sister just abandoned his mission, but Sister is still trying to find any clue, unaware that his prey hides in plain sight. His biggest worry is that Zimmer, the source of the contract, might hire someone else for the job.",
    "He is a regular patron over at the Muddy Rudder, drinking any alcohol he can get his hands on, including whiskey",
