    "Lieutenant Markland is an NCR army doctor stationed at Bitter Springs in 2281.",
    "Markland is the medical officer and field medic at Bitter Springs. While he has extensive medical knowledge and field first aid (treating trench foot, making a tourniquet, etc.), he was not trained to treat the psychological trauma from which many of the refugees suffer.",
    "Markland is markedly tall, much like Arcade Gannon, Aurelius of Phoenix and Lucullus."
