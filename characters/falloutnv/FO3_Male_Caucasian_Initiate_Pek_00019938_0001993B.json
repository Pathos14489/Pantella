    "Initiate Pek is an initiate in the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 3.",
    "Initiate Pek is young, inexperienced, and very headstrong.",
    "By the time the Lone Wanderer arrives in Falls Church, Hoss and the other paladin are continuing to fight the super mutants outside, while Pek is still trapped in the office building. The Lone Wanderer can offer to help Hoss rescue the young initiate, whereupon they are sent alone into the building to retrieve him while the others guard the outside. Upon meeting them, Pek is glad that someone has been sent to rescue him, as he was confident that Hoss would not leave him behind.",
    "Pek has a strong relationship with Paladin Hoss, as he was confident that Hoss would not leave him behind after they were separated."
