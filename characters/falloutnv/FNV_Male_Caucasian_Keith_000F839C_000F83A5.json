    "Keith is a chem dealer and caravan hustler living in suite 200 of Aerotech Office Park in 2281.",
    "Keith has made his home in the Aerotech Office Park, where he has developed a dubious reputation. For one, he \"makes his own luck\" with some marked cards and hustles peoples at caravan, especially when a \"fat score rolls into town.\"",
    "Captain Captain Parker suspects that Keith is selling unlicensed chems and conning people,",
    "Keith's Caravan Charade",
    "Keith's Caravan Charade: The player character has to find evidence of Keith cheating at Caravan. A Barter check of 45 is needed to trick him into telling about his drug dealing and a Speech check of 60 is needed when talking to him to find out how he cheats. Alternatively, the Courier can also steal the cards out of the desk in the back right corner of the 200 suite and bring them to Captain Parker as evidence."
