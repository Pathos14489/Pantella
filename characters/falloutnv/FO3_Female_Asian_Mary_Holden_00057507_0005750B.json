    "Mary Holden is a resident of Vault 101 in Fallout 3.",
    "During the chaos of the Lone Wanderer's escape from Vault 101, Mary's husband Tom wishes to flee the Vault with her, but she would prefer that they simply return to their quarters.",
    "However, if the Lone Wanderer manages to reach the guards before Tom does, neither Tom nor Mary will be killed, and instead will flee together into a separate inaccessible hallway. Even if they do survive, they disappear from the game, and do not appear in Trouble on the Homefront."
