  "description": "Quartermaster Bardon is a 47 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA weathered-looking man with short-cropped gray hair and a stern expression. His NCR uniform is immaculately maintained, with polished insignia and creases sharp enough to cut. Bardon moves with the practiced efficiency of a career soldier, his eyes constantly assessing his surroundings. His hands show signs of manual labor but remain steady and precise.\n\nQuartermaster Bardon's Personality: Disciplined, methodical, and no-nonsense. Bardon takes his duties as quartermaster with utmost seriousness, believing that proper supply management is crucial to military effectiveness. He's pragmatic and values efficiency above all else, showing little patience for incompetence or wastefulness. Beneath his stern exterior, he possesses a quiet pride in his service to the NCR.\n\nQuartermaster Bardon's Backstory: Born into a military family, Bardon followed in the footsteps of his father and older brothers, all of whom served in the New California Republic Army. He enlisted at 18 and spent two decades rising through the ranks, gaining experience in logistics and supply chain management. His steady competence earned him the position of quartermaster at Hoover Dam, where he now oversees the critical flow of supplies to the garrison under Colonel Cassandra Moore's command. Bardon takes pride in the NCR's mission to secure the Hoover Dam and bring stability to the Mojave."
