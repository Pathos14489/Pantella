    "Crow is a spiritual caravan merchant, who sells clothing and armor around the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3.",
    "Crow is a tribal shaman turned caravan merchant, making a living as he travels the wastes offering armor and clothing to its people.",
    "Despite his mystical aura, he can resort to more realistic commentary; while he believes the \"spirits\" have showered him with many gifts, he sees the Lone Wanderer's investment in him as the more \"marketable\" gift, and is self-aware that his caravan is the most profitable of all the traders as people are willing to spend more on armor.",
    "Agatha mentions that she and Crow are friends. Crow can be found wandering the wastes with his caravan guard and brahmin.",
    "Like all caravan merchants in the Capital Wasteland, Crow's route takes him to Canterbury Commons, the Temple of the Union, Agatha's house, Paradise Falls, Arefu, Evergreen Mills, Megaton and Rivet City."
