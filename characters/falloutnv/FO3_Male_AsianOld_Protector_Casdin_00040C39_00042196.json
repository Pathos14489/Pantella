    "Protector Henry Casdin is the leader of the Brotherhood of Steel Outcasts in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3. He is also a special dweller in Fallout Shelter Online.",
    "Level-headed and professional, Protector Casdin was once one of the most accomplished soldiers of Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel and traveled with Owyn Lyons during the expedition. He fought with the Elder side-by-side during the Scourge of the Pitt.",
    "Under Casdin's command, they seized Fort Independence, where they pushed back the indigenous raider groups and adapted the former military base for use as their headquarters. Termed \"Outcasts\" by their angered former brothers and sisters, the renegade soldiers adopted the name as a badge of honor,",
    "Since then, Casdin has led them with a steady hand, attempting to reestablish communications with the West. He considers Lyons a traitor who abandoned his mission.",
    "Protector Casdin can be found standing at the entrance to Fort Independence, the headquarters of the Brotherhood Outcasts. He holds one of several keys to Fort Independence.",
    "He was one of the best paladins and one of the original members who followed Lyons from the western headquarters of the Brotherhood. He fought alongside the High Elder at the Battle of Pittsburgh and was a staunch believer in the Brotherhood's ideals. After Owyn Lyons changed the Brotherhood's course of action in the wasteland of the capital, Castin showed clear dissatisfaction and incomprehension. After the conflict escalated, he led the members who were willing to follow him into the wasteland, taking most of Lyons' supplies and abandoning the Citadel, establishing the Brotherhood Outcasts.",
    "Deals 74% of ATK plus 2466 points of damage to all enemies 4 times. Every time the skill passes through a person, the damage increases by 20%, up to 6 times.",
    "All damage caused by self increases by 1078 points, and a burning effect is added, causing damage equal to 1% of the target's maximum life once. Each time the damage does not exceed 0.6 times Henry Casdin's initial attack power, and when the self's life is greater than 50%, The burn effect applied is not immune and cannot be dispelled. Every time Henry Castine deals damage, the target's Rage will be reduced by 5%.",
    "The reflection damage received by all of us is reduced by 50% and an additional 2097 points are added.",
    "The attack power of the party increases by 1254 points.",
    "The initial rage increases by 200 points, and when the life of our residents is greater than or equal to 80%, the attack power increases by 10%, and the physical resistance and energy resistance increase by 10%.",
    "When the number of surviving residents of our side is less than the number of surviving residents of the enemy, the damage received by our residents is reduced by 18%.",
    "When the number of our surviving residents is greater than or equal to the number of surviving enemies, the damage caused by dwellers increases by 10% and the damage Henry Casdin receives is reduced by 80%.",
    "Henry Casdin appears in Fallout 3 and in Fallout Shelter Online.",
    "Protector Casdin's field report is recorded by a different voice actor than Casdin's in-game voice. However, the field report mentions requests for reinforcements that are denied. As Casdin is the leader of the Outcasts, it does not make sense that he would have a superior that could deny reinforcements. Considering the voice discrepancy and this otherwise illogical request, it is possible that the field report was recorded by another member of the Outcasts on Casdin's behalf, or another out-of-universe explanation may simply be that the report was made before Casdin's character was fully developed. Defender Rockfowl's field report, similarly, is recorded by a different voice actor.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 Casdin may enter Fort Independence and never exit."
