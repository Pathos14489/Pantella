    "Daniel Wyand, also known as Courier Four, was a courier working for the Mojave Express, found dead outside the Nash residence in Primm in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Daniel Wyand was the fourth of six Mojave Express couriers hired to fulfill an order sent by Robert House and set up with Johnson Nash by Victor in 2281. His corpse can be found in the town of Primm lying outside the Mojave Express building, and like the Courier, was shot in the head but did not survive a bullet to the brain. The Fallout: New Vegas Official Game Guide indicates that it is possible that he and the Courier also knew each other.",
    "Besides the Courier, he is the only other in-game character who is carrying a Mojave Express delivery order. Daniel's package consisted of two oversized fuzzy dice, which was delivered to the north entrance of the New Vegas Strip. His package was one of five decoys, all delivered successfully and paid for, set up to distract attention away from the true package, which carried the platinum chip being delivered by the Courier as per delivery order #6.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 Sometimes, Wyand's corpse may disappear then reappear later on."
