Daniel maintains a calm demeanor under pressure and values trust and reliability in his work.\n\nDaniel Wyand's Backstory: Daniel Wyand worked as a courier for the Mojave Express for several years before October 11th, 2281. He was selected by the company's management to deliver one of five decoy packages that would distract potential threats from the true delivery of the platinum chip. Despite the dangerous nature of the operation, Daniel completed his delivery successfully and has since been keeping a low profile, occasionally taking on smaller courier jobs in the Mojave Wasteland."
