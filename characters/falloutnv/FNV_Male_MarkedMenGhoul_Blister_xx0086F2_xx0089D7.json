    "Blister is a member of the marked men encountered in the Divide in 2281 and the first of four named marked men. He appears in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Lonesome Road.",
    "As evidenced by his wearing of marked patrol armor, Blister was once a member of the New California Republic Rangers as a patrol Ranger until the destruction of the Divide prior to 2277. By 2281, he is a hunter and one of the few named marked men, leading the warband operating out of a ruined structure between the Hopeville Missile Base and the collapsed overpass tunnel connected to the High Road.",
    "Blister's health and combat skills are higher than those of a normal marked man. As befitting his name, he fights using a flamer, bathing his enemies in blistering fire.",
    "Unlike the other three named marked men, Blister has five tagged skills but also has the lowest HP among all of them.",
    "The Job",
    "Despite primarily wielding a flamer as his weapons, Blister's Guns skill level is at the maximum 100, higher than his base Energy Weapons skill level of 89 and even still with his apparel's effects raising it to 95.",
    "Blister appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Lonesome Road.",
