    "Everett, also referred to as the foreman is a Pitt raider, usually found in The Mill in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "Everett coordinates the effort to recover steel ingots from the Pitt steelyard. He enjoys sending slaves to their likely demise but is not without some sympathy for their struggle.",
    "He is originally dismissive of the Lone Wanderer and their abilities when they are first sent to him as the newest member of the ingot collection team, believing that they wouldn’t last long against the various dangers of the steelyard.",
    "As the Lone Wanderer progresses through collecting the ingots in the steelyard, they will acquire a unique item from Everett for every ten ingots they deliver to him, with the majority of these unique items having a story as to how Everett acquired them.",
    "Everett appears only in The Pitt add-on for Fallout 3.",
    "Everett's name is a reference to the town of Everett, Pennsylvania, which is visible from the Pennsylvania Turnpike."
