    "Split Jack is the leader of a mercenary gang in the Capital Wasteland, roughly two weeks after the activation of Project Purity in 2277/2278.",
    "Once an average wasteland raider, Split Jack cleaned up his act and began to combine his ruthless tendencies with a head for business. Now in charge of a group of bandits, he has come up with a plan for theft and extortion of the Water Distribution Network. His plan is to attack the water caravans en route to gather Aqua Pura and harass the network, then go to the network and get themselves hired as security for the increased attacks on the caravans.",
    "Split Jack is recruiting bandits to this end,",
    "He has established a simple power hierarchy among his crew, and the rules for his bandits are simple. The toughest, those with the mettle, lead. In practice, his underlings do what he says when he says to.",
    "Split Jack is always at Wilhelm's Wharf, leading his crew.",
    "Split Jack appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel."
