    "Private Stone is a soldier serving the New California Republic at Camp Forlorn Hope in 2281.",
    "The New California Republic's war with Caesar's Legion has taken a massive physical toll on its citizens and the emotional and mental toll on its soldiers. Stone is one of the troopers who is heavily laden with the burden of war, especially due to being located at the crucible of the worst of the fighting, in Camp Forlorn Hope.",
    "The constant terror created by the threat of Legion raids or even a full on assault has taken a heavy toll on Private Stone, and no longer being able to handle it, he begins using the hallucinogen known as hydra, which he steals from the Camp Forlorn Hope medical center at night. It gives him a temporary relief from the fear and anxiety which is constant in a place in such a dire situation like Forlorn Hope.",
    "The  Courier can speak with him to hear his side of the story and ask more questions about the camp and the situation with the Legion. Afterward, they can think about the sitution and decide how to handle his transgressions. If he is turned in, he can be found in the camp jail cell.",
    "Killing him while in prison will not lose NCR reputation, but one will be attacked if choosing to do so."
