    "Rory Maclaren is a slave being held in Paradise Falls in the year 2277.",
    "Instead of waiting until someone wants to purchase him, he is highly motivated to escape and is constantly thinking of escape methods. He dislikes being pushed around and has attacked his captors many times. He is forced to be in the Box permanently where unruly slaves go.",
    "Rescue From Paradise",
    "Rescue from Paradise: As a condition of leaving Paradise Falls, Penny will ask the Lone Wanderer to escort Rory to the entrance.",
    "Once freed, he will travel to Moriarty's Saloon. Provided he survives, he will stand in the room to the right where Mr. Burke is found. When attempting dialogue, he will only say \"Hey. Talk fast, they hate it when I talk to customers.\"",
    "His line \"Can't nobody eat fifty eggs,\" is a reference to the film Cool Hand Luke."
