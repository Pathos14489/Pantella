    "Defender Morrill is a member of the Brotherhood Outcasts located at Bailey's Crossroads in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage. He stays outside the facility with the Outcasts to defend against periodic attacks from the super mutants.",
    "Morrill is a veteran soldier who has fought in more battles than he would like, operating under the command of Protector McGraw. His latest assignment is at the VSS facility at Bailey's Crossroads, where he coordinates surface defenses against hordes of super mutants determined to wipe the Outcasts out. He also performs special operations for McGraw, such as a daring raid on Vault 108 and the abduction of Gary 23, in an attempt to acquire a Pip-Boy necessary to crack the VSS vault.",
    "However, the attempt failed: Gary 23 died under interrogation, Specialist Olin is back at square one, and Morrill is stuck trying to keep the super mutants at bay. Due to a recent surge in their activity, Morrill decided to send out an urgent radio broadcast for help, requesting any available Outcasts to come to their aid at sector 7-B - Bailey's Crossroads.",
    "Defender Morrill appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "Outcast members Sibley, Olin, McGraw and Morrill, all of who appear in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage, appear to be named after buildings on the campus of Cornell University, including Sibley Hall, Olin Hall, Olin Library, McGraw Hall, McGraw Tower and Morrill Hall."
