    "Chavez is a Powder Ganger living at Powder Ganger camp south in 2281.",
    "Chavez formed a splinter gang with a small crew of fellow escaped convicts that have moved south of the NCR Correctional Facility to plunder passing-by traders and other Mojave inhabitants. Chavez and his crew decided that instead of turning in their \"acquisitions\" to Eddie, they would keep it all for themselves.",
    "There was originally an option that Chavez could have been imprisoned during I Fought the Law, but this was cut from the game."
