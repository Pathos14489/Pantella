    "Defender Anne Marie Morgan is a soldier of the Brotherhood of Steel Outcasts, stationed at Fort Independence in Fallout 3.",
    "Posted on the perimeter of Fort Independence alongside Rococo Rockfowl, Defender Morgan is a tough soldier who does not take her duties lightly. She is a close friend of Protector Henry Casdin, the leader of the Outcasts, and is fiercely loyal to their cause.",
    "Most wastelanders approaching the Outcasts' base will quickly learn to respect her laser rifle and no-nonsense attitude.",
    "The easiest way to impress Morgan is to keep up with her. She is erudite and well read, seeing Elder Lyons as Captain Ahab from Moby-Dick, in that his crusade against the super mutants will get him and others killed in the end.",
    "Morgan is set to respawn, which is unusual for named non-player characters. Due to her location, she may be attacked and killed by random enemies (usually raiders in nearby Fairfax) as she patrols the area around the fort. In this case, she respawns after every 24-48 in-game hours."
