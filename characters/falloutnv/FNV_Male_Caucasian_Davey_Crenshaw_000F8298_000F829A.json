    "Pvt. Davey Crenshaw is an NCR soldier living at Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "Davey Crenshaw is an undisciplined and self-centered trooper This has earned him the ire of all those who serve with him.",
    "Two of Crenshaw's shenanigans are of particular note; the first is the time he led a brahmin into the upstairs section of the terminal building. Not only because brahmin cannot go downstairs, but also because it visited him in the cell multiple times. Another time was the time he dropped firecrackers into the toilets, completely destroying them. The inability to repair and/or replace them led his fellow servicemen to want to shoot him. Crenshaw himself believing the only reason that they didn't was due to how shorthanded they were.",
    "His conduct has earned him a reputation as a \"problem child\" and has had multiple disciplinary hearings,",
    "This situation was manipulated by frumentarius Picus. Using Crenshaw's reputation against the NCR he came up with the plan to use Crenshaw as a fall guy for his ongoing sabotage and infiltration. Convincing the entire base wouldn't be a hard sell,",
    "I Put a Spell on You: If the Courier chooses the Legion's side, Crenshaw is to be killed in order to frame him for destroying the NCR monorail. Because he is well known as a prankster, when the player character talks to Colonel Hsu, he will believe that Crenshaw planted the bomb on the monorail.",
    "If the Courier decides to talk to him before killing him, the option comes up for them to pull the pin off his grenade by passing a 40 Sneak check.",
    "Despite being able to pull the pin off Crenshaw's grenade, he has no grenade in his inventory."
