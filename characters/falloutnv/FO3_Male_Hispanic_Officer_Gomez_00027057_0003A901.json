    "Officer Herman Gomez is a resident and security officer of Vault 101 in the year 2277.",
    "Officer Gomez is a straight example of the \"good cop.\" The father of Freddie Gomez, he tries his best to keep his son away from the Tunnel Snakes' influence. However, he knows that this is difficult because there are few other children Freddie's age in the vault.",
    "When returning to the vault during Trouble on the Homefront, he will have an entirely different voice type. This is due to him using the same dialogue as Officer Armstrong, who would appear in the quest fulfilling Gomez's role if he died during Escape! Since no dialogue was recorded separately by Jeff Baker, Gomez was simply given the same dialogue."
