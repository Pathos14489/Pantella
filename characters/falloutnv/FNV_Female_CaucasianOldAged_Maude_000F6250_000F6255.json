    "Maude is an elderly female prostitute working for Pretty Sarah at the Casa Madrid in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The oldest prostitute at the Casa, Maude considers herself spry enough to make a living out of sex work (provided her back doesn't give out), compensating for the lack of her looks with experience",
    "While Maude has plenty of confidence, Pretty Sarah considers her to be the \"discount\" option for customers who can't afford Sweetie (Maude asks for just a quarter of what Sweetie does) or who like older women.",
    "Maude is homophobic, disapproving of Jimmy and considering Sweetie perverted for having female clients.",
