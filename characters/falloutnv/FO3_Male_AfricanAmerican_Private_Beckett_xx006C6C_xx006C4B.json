    "Private Beckett is a soldier found in the cryo lab section of Mothership Zeta in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta.",
    "Beckett was part of Elliott Tercorien's medic squad, under the command of Sergeant Daniels. Assigned to the 108th Infantry Battalion, the six medics were responsible for dealing with casualties from fighting the Chinese Army during the Battle of Anchorage.",
    "His primary role was as a stretcher bearer, moving wounded troops to safe areas to provide medical aid or for evacuation to the rear lines. Beckett was abducted in the middle of the night,",
    "Unlike Tercorien, Beckett and the others were used for torturous medical experiments, which would leave them in horrific pain were they conscious.",
    "* He receives a Chinese assault rifle from Elliott if he is correctly revived.",
    "Beckett appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta.",
    "Beckett appears to have two voice actors. Most of his dialogue is voiced by the same actor as Elliott Tercorien, who is uncredited and unknown. However, the line said upon his exit from cryostasis (\"Agh...feels like someone rearranged my insides. What happened to us?\") is voiced by audio director Mark Lampert. Beckett shares this distinction with Daniels."
