  "description": "Ricardo 'Rico' Vasquez is a 34 year-old Hispanic Male.\n\nA deceased Hispanic mercenary found on the fourth floor of the Anchorage Memorial facility section. He wears tattered combat armor and carries a 10mm pistol. His body shows signs of a violent struggle, suggesting he may have encountered unexpected resistance from the mirelurk farmers he was sent to eliminate.\n\nRicardo 'Rico' Vasquez's Personality: Cold and calculating, Rico was motivated by greed and survival. He was pragmatic and willing to do whatever it took to complete a contract, showing little remorse for his actions. Despite his ruthless nature, he had a code of sorts - he never double-crossed an employer and always collected his payment.\n\nRicardo 'Rico' Vasquez's Backstory: Born in the ruins of what was once Boston, Rico learned to survive in the harsh wasteland from a young age. He fell in with a raider group in his teens but eventually struck out on his own as a mercenary. Rico had a reputation for being reliable but dangerous, taking on jobs others would refuse. His final contract came from an anonymous employer who wanted to eliminate a group of wastelanders who had established a mirelurk farm deep within the Anchorage Memorial. Rico was promised a substantial payment and more lucrative contracts if he succeeded. Unfortunately for him, the mirelurk farmers proved more organized and better prepared than he anticipated."
