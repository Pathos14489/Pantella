  "description": "Easy Pete is a 68 year-old African American Male.\n\nA former prospector living in Goodsprings who now takes it easy while offering occasional advice.\n\nEasy Pete's Personality: Easygoing and relaxed, but knowledgeable and willing to share wisdom when asked.\n\nEasy Pete's Backstory: Easy Pete was once a prospector in the Mojave Wasteland, searching for valuable tech, chems, and weapons. During his time as a prospector, he became an expert in explosives, though it cost him his hearing in one ear. While he doesn't agree with the NCR's expansionist politics, he acknowledges their positive qualities and their role in keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Now in his later years, he has settled in Goodsprings, where he occasionally works as a farmhand."
