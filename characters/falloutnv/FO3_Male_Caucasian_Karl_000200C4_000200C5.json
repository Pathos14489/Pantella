    "Karl is a member of the Family in Capital Wasteland in 2277.",
    "Karl was married to a woman named Skyler and they lived together in Meresti before her death. They used to be shop owners in Megaton, and Vance encountered them while getting supplies. Vance felt a kinship with them and invited them to join him. Karl is gruff and has a short temper; he prefers others leave him alone. He is cynical, suspicious of others and thinks the worst of them.",
    "Karl does not believe in Vance's vampiric teachings but plays the part in order to keep his store in the Meresti Metro Station. "
