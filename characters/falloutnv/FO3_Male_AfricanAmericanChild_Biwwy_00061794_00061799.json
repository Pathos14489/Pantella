    "Biwwy is a nine-year-old inhabitant of Little Lamplight, recently kicked off the scavenging team due to his speech impediment annoying the other children to a point where they no longer wished to listen to him.",
    "Biwwy doesn't seem to have any friends, as everyone finds him annoying, possibly because of his speech impediment and apparent hyperactive nature.",
    "Biwwy (or Billy) wields a unique laser rifle called the \"Wazer Wifle\" which can be bought from him for 500 caps or 250 with sufficient points in the Barter skill. If one has the Child at Heart perk, the Wazer Wifle can be obtained for free."
