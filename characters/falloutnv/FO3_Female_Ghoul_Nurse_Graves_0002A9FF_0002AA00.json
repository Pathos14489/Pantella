    "Nurse Graves is a ghoul who helps Doctor Barrows in Underworld in Fallout 3.",
    "Young by ghoul standards, Doctor Barrows' assistant Nurse Graves is knowledgeable and keen. She helps in Barrows' experiments to diagnose and treat the various brand-new ailments that ghouls are always complaining about. Happy with her lot in life, she spends her time cutting up corpses, inspecting brain tissue samples, and poking feral ghouls with a variety of (mainly sharp) implements.",
    "Unlike other ghouls in the Fallout universe, she sympathizes with humans as much as ghouls (stating they were all the same once) while most other ghouls and humans are on non-friendly terms. She will mention that Doctor Barrows performed experiments on Reilly while she was in her coma",
    "Her name \"Graves\" refers to burial graves, a reference to the Underworld's theme of death."
