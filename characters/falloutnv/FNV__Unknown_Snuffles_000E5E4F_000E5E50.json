  "description": "Snuffles is a 1 year-old Mole rat Unknown.\n\nA friendly yet injured mole rat that has been tamed by the quarry workers in Sloan. Despite its small size and apparent vulnerability, Snuffles has become an unlikely mascot for the settlement, providing comfort and amusement to the hardworking miners with its playful antics.\n\nSnuffles's Personality: Friendly, loyal, and resilient. Snuffles maintains a cheerful disposition despite its injury, bringing joy to those around it. It's curious but cautious, especially around strangers, and shows remarkable intelligence for its species.\n\nSnuffles's Backstory: Snuffles was found by the quarry workers in Sloan several months ago, barely clinging to life after what appeared to be a predator attack. Rather than leaving the creature to its fate, Chomps Lewis and the other workers took pity on the small animal and nursed it back to health. Over time, the mole rat became attached to its rescuers, eventually becoming a permanent fixture in the quarry camp. The injury to its hind leg has healed but left a slight limp, which doesn't seem to bother Snuffles in the least."
