  "description": "Davis West is a 65 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nAn elderly resident of Arefu, Davis West lived a quiet family life with his wife Matilda, son Ian, and daughter Lucy. He was a hardworking man who provided for his family and was respected in the small community.\n\nDavis West's Personality: Kind and caring but somewhat oblivious to family problems. Davis valued his family's safety and happiness above all else, though he sometimes struggled to connect with his children on a deeper level.\n\nDavis West's Backstory: Born before the Great War, Davis West grew up in the pre-War United States. Like many, his life was turned upside down by the nuclear devastation of 2077. He spent decades as a wanderer in the Capital Wasteland before finding stability in the isolated mountain community of Arefu over ten years prior to 2277. There, he settled down with his wife Matilda and raised two children, Ian and Lucy. While Lucy eventually left to seek her fortune in Megaton, Davis remained in Arefu, unaware of the growing vampirism crisis affecting his son."
