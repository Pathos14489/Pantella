    "Davis West was an inhabitant of Arefu in 2277.",
    "Prior to the incident that left both him and his wife Matilda dead, Davis had lived in Arefu for over ten years with his wife, son Ian and daughter Lucy, though Lucy had recently left to make it on her own in the town of Megaton.",
    "Although Lucy had been aware of Ian’s craving and had helped him ward it off for some time before her departure, neither Ian nor Lucy ever told their parents about the issue, having felt that neither of them would understand.",
    "He and his wife are both treated as props, rather than bodies, and are immune to being dismembered, even by a high power weapon such as the minigun."
