    "Layla is a deserter from the New California Republic hiding out in Primm in 2281.",
    "A demoralized soldier of the New California Republic Army, Layla and her three fellow soldiers have thrown away their uniforms and deserted from the front lines of the war with Caesar's Legion, to avoid the risk of capture and torture at the hands of the legionaries.",
    "New Canaan up north is an attractive option to them, though they lost all their money gambling in New Vegas and must come up with creative ways of generating income. The Courier can choose to deal with the deserters in several ways, resulting in their deaths or the group leaving Primm, headed for New Canaan.",
    "Killing her, or her team of thugs, as they flee after completing A Team of Moronic Mercenaries peacefully has no affect on Karma, and items in the casino that have changed from owned to unowned will remain lootable without loss of Karma. Their bodies also remain in the casino."
