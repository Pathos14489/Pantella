    "George Neusbaum is one of the inhabitants of Vault 112 and part of the Tranquility Lane virtual reality simulation, still alive in Fallout 3.",
    "Resident ID 374 in lounger 37,",
    "Here, George was brainwashed to be the head of the Neusbaum household, proud husband of Pat and father of Timmy, with an honorable discharge from the American military. Braun ensured some friction within the family: Timmy was set to be a weakling, easily tormented by Betty (Braun's form within the simulation), which led Neusbaum to consider sending his son to a military academy, where he'd be toughened up - enough to face the real world that would never come.",
    "George is generally on good terms with other victims within Tranquility Lane, even with the seemingly senile Old Lady Dithers.",
    "When it comes to women, he's faithful to Pat, but likes to stay on top of the local gossip, the main source of which is Mabel Henderson. His wife isn't too keen on her or her gossiping, and George loves to tease Pat over it.",
    "His vital signs after 200 years of imprisonment are 75 bpm pulse, blood pressure is 118/82 mmHG, temperature  37.056°C or 98.7°C, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and nominal levels of stress: Perfectly normal for an adult male."
