    "Melissa Lewis is a Great Khan member camped out near Quarry Junction in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Melissa is the daughter of Chomps Lewis and a member of the Great Khans.",
    "Melissa and two other Khans are awaiting a chems shipment at the Great Khan encampment above Quarry Junction.",
    "Melissa is unaware of, and unrelated to, the Great Khan crew led by Jessup and McMurphy that ambushed the Courier under Benny, and she does not know of any other Great Khan gangs operating as far into NCR territory as she is (not that she would willingly out a fellow Great Khan).",
    "Melissa's New Zealand accent was the result of a miscommunication between Joshua Sawyer and another developer that ignored his instructions for all characters native to the Mojave Wasteland to have American accents. Although Sawyer stated that it was a good performance, the strong accent was unintentional and by the time he heard the voice lines, it was too late to change it."
