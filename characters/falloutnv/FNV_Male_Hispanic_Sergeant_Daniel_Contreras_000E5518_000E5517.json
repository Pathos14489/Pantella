    "Sgt. Daniel Contreras is an NCR supply merchant in Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "The head of the Camp McCarran supply shack, Contreras is about as shady as they come, without being found behind bars. Just how he managed to become the supply manager for the entire Camp McCarran is not entirely clear, but he has held that position for a while. The NCR military police is aching for an excuse to put him before a court martial, but so far he has been staying ahead of Lieutenant Carrie Boyd. Despite weekly inventory checks coming up short on guns and ammo, he holds on to his position, always pawning the goods away before the MPs come to search his possessions and quarters again.",
    "The MPs' suspicions are ultimately valid. Contreras uses his position as a supply sergeant to steal weapons and ammunition meant for Army use and resell them on the black market to mercenaries and the like.",
    "Beyond guns, Contreras also uses his connections to acquire chemical components that are ostensibly for medical use by the Army,",
    "Contreras was written by area designer Robert Lee."
