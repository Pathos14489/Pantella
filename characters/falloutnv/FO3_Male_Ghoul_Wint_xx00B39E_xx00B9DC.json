    "Wint is a ghoul found in the Old Olney underground in the year 2277.",
    "Part of Sanders' group of ghoul settlers, trying to set up a place like the Underworld (only better), Wint and his partner, Kidd, are the only survivors. What seemed like a good idea at the time turned out to be a complete disaster when the ghouls found out just why Old Olney was abandoned: Deathclaws came at them full bore when they knocked down walls in the undergrond to expand their living area.",
    "The only reason he and Kidd survived was because they ran faster than the rest and managed to get clear of the nest while the deathclaws were busy ripping the rest of the ghouls apart.",
    "Anyone trying to go in the opposite direction, such as the Lone Wanderer searching for lost technology, is better off turning around and running away, in Wint's opinion.",
    "Shock Value: Upon entering the Old Olney underground to find a Tesla coil, Wint and Kidd can be encountered fleeing the fledgling ghoul community. Wint can provide some information on what happened, after which he and Kidd will leave using the ladder and disappear permanently.",
    "Wint appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel.",
    "Wint and Kidd are named after the eponymous assassin pair from Ian Fleming's Diamonds Are Forever novel and its film adaptation. In the latter, the two assassins are portrayed as a gay couple.",
