    "Ranger Ghost is a member of the New California Republic's Rangers stationed at their border outpost in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. She appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Known by the nickname \"Ghost,\"",
    "Although she is an NCR patriot through and through, Ghost does not share in the imperialist zeal of the republic's upper echelons championed by President Aaron Kimball around the turn of the 2280s. In fact, she is world-wise enough to both recognize a load of malarkey and dismiss its validity just as quickly.",
    "Despite the calm surroundings she finds herself in daily, Ghost admits she is constantly on edge,",
    "If the player character has a Sneak skill level at or above 60 when speaking to Ranger Ghost for the first time, she will have unique dialogue commenting on their ability to surprise her;",
    "The Gun Runners' Arsenal challenge Armed For Bear can be advanced/completed by killing Ranger Ghost with the required weapons; see the article for details."
