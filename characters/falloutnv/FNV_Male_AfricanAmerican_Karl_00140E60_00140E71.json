    "Karl is a frumentarius for Caesar's Legion quartering in Red Rock Canyon in 2281, acting as the Legion's emissary to the Great Khans.",
    "Karl is one of the Legion's frumentarii, whose duty is to scout the wastes and make contact with tribes that may be able to help further Caesar's cause.  While he professes to respect the Great Khans as fellow warriors, the reality is quite different, as his journal shows. Located in a footlocker in his room at the Great Khan longhouse, the journal reveals that Karl, in his time as a guest of the Great Khans, has developed considerable contempt for them and views them as nothing more than barbarous savages. He deliberately hides the fact that the Legion forbids women from being anything more than servants and slaves, even telling a female Khan that she will be able to serve in Caesar's army as an explorer.",
    " If the Courier has low reputation with the Legion, Karl may attack on sight. The Great Khans will not intervene for the Courier or Karl.",
