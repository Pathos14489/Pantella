    "Martha Simpson is one of the inhabitants of Vault 112 trapped inside the Tranquility Lane virtual reality simulation in Fallout 3.",
    "Resident 227 of Vault 112, Martha has been trapped with her fellow dwellers by Stanislaus Braun for over 200 years.",
    "The irony is that while there was some chemistry between Roger and Martha, Rockwell pushed her away and denied it, much to Martha's frustration. He wanted to keep his marriage intact. Janet noticed that chemistry too, but after a bitter fight in front of an open window earlier in the year, she finally believed Roger's word.",
    "It seems that she's also been ostracized from the community to a degree. Only Mabel Henderson shows consistent interest in her life, and the two are good friends.",
    "Henderson's vitals indicate a state of elevated stress: 92 beats per minute, 150/80 mmHg of blood pressure, 98.9°F/37.16°C temperature, and 20 breaths per minute, similar to Timmy Neusbaum."
