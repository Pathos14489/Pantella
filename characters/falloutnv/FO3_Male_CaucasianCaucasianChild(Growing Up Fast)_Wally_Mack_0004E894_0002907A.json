    "Wally Mack is a resident of Vault 101 in 2277 and is a member of a greaser gang called the Tunnel Snakes.",
    "Wally is the son of Allen and Gloria Mack. Wally's siblings are Stevie and Susie.",
    "Wally is the brains of the Tunnel Snakes. Butch DeLoria and Paul Hannon Jr. are Wally's friends and fellow gang members. During their formative years, the Tunnel Snakes harassed other students in Vault 101, even being bold enough to taunt the overseer's daughter, Amata Almodovar. Butch presumes to be the leader of the Tunnel Snakes, but Wally might disagree if challenged.",
    "He does not talk as much as the others, but they listen to what he has to say when he does say something. He is one of the Lone Wanderer's peers in Vault 101 and is encountered throughout the Lone Wanderer's youth inside Vault 101.",
    "By 2287, Mack had traveled to the Commonwealth, where he reestablished the Tunnel Snakes under his rule.",
    "Over time, Mack and the other Tunnel Snakes succumbed to radiation sickness and transformed into feral ghouls. Wally Mack himself became a Glowing One.",
    "* Has it only equipped during Future Imperfect\n** Has it only equipped during Trouble on the Homefront",
    "Wally Mack appears in Fallout 3 and in the Fallout 4 Creation Club content \"Tunnel Snakes Rule!\""
