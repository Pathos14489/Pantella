    "Officer Steve \"Stevie\" Mack is a security officer in Vault 101 in 2277.",
    "He is Susie and Wally Mack's brother, and Allen Mack and Gloria Mack's son. Stevie is 25 years old as of the events of Escape! He is a sadistic and gung-ho member of the Vault's security force, and willing to do anything to gain favor with his boss, including being particularly overzealous during emergencies.",
    "He is responsible for the killing of Jonas Palmer.",
    "* He will only drop a finger during Escape!",
    "* He will only wear the helmet during Trouble on the Homefront.",
    "A teenaged Stevie was originally slated to appear during the birthday party in Growing Up Fast. An unused model exists in the G.E.C.K., and a single line of dialogue for the quest can be found in the files as well."
