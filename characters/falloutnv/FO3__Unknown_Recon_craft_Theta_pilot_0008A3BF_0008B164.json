  "description": "Zetan Pilot is a 35 year-old Zetan Male.\n\nA deceased Zetan alien found in the cockpit of the crashed recon craft Theta at the alien crash site. The pilot's body shows severe trauma from the impact, with greenish blood staining the controls and seat.\n\nZetan Pilot's Personality: As a scout pilot, the Zetan would have been observant, cautious, analytical, and loyal to the Zetan collective. The final moments of their life likely involved frantic attempts to send distress signals to the mothership.\n\nZetan Pilot's Backstory: The Zetan pilot was part of a scouting mission sent from the mothership Zeta to survey Earth. In August 2277, the pilot's scout ship, Theta, malfunctioned and crashed in the Capital Wasteland. Despite efforts to send a distress signal, the pilot did not survive the crash."
