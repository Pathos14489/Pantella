  "description": "Lucky Harith is a 38 year-old African American Male.\n\nHarith is an easily excitable traveling caravan merchant who considers himself a 'student on the path of the wasteland.' He provides safety to wanderers through his trading of weaponry and essential supplies.\n\nLucky Harith's Personality: Easily excitable, optimistic, and resourceful. Lucky Harith is always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in the harsh wasteland environment. He's friendly and approachable, but can be shrewd when it comes to trading.\n\nLucky Harith's Backstory: Lucky Harith grew up in the remnants of a pre-War African American community in the Capital Wasteland. After losing his family to raiders, he joined Ernest Roe's caravan at a young age and has been traveling the wasteland ever since. Over the years, he's built a reputation as a reliable merchant who always has quality goods and fair prices. He considers the wasteland his classroom, learning something new from each settlement he visits."
