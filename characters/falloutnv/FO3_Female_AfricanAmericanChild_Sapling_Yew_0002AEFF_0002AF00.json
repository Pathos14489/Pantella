    "Sapling Yew is a bright young girl living in Oasis in the year 2277.",
    "She is the only child of the Oasis village leaders, Tree Father Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel. She does gardening with her mother and enjoys playing in the grove, climbing on and around the god-spirit, and touching her bear charm. She is the closest thing to a friend Harold has among the Treeminders, by virtue of being the only one who actually listens to him.",
    "Yew is the common name for genus Taxus, a type of tree and with \"sapling\" meaning a young tree. All of the human residents in Oasis have horticultural names."
