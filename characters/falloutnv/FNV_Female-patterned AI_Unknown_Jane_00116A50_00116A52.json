    "Jane is one of Mr. House's Securitron \"girls\" found in the Lucky 38 penthouse in 2281.",
    "Jane's neuro-computational matrix is a copy of a woman that Mr. House had known as \"one of Mr. House's girls.\" Jane makes sure to keep Mr. House \"entertained,\" even after giving up his physical needs.",
    "Jane is a reference to the 1950s film star Jane Russell, who began her film career in a movie with Howard Hughes, the man upon who Robert House is based. In real life, Jane Russell was friends with Marilyn Monroe. A Securitron Marilyn was intended to appear in the game, as seen in the concept art and the Collector's Edition playing cards, but was cut from the final release."
