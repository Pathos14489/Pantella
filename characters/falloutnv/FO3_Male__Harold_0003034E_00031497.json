    "Harold is a unique FEV mutant who once resembled a typical ghoul, until his physiology was gradually changed by a parasitic tree he calls Bob. He survived the Great War in a Vault and has witnessed pivotal events throughout post-War history.",
    "He is first encountered as an impoverished mutant eking out an existence in Old Town, remembering the Master before his rise in Fallout. In Fallout 2, he is the foreman and mayor of Gecko. Harold ultimately crossed the country and became rooted to the ground, and in Fallout 3 he is worshipped as a deity at Oasis. Harold was also planned to appear in several canceled Fallout games, and has been depicted in official materials outside of the main series.",
    "Rising to prominence as a caravan master in the formative years of the Hub, he would meet the future Master, travel to Mariposa Military Base, undergo a change into a ghoul-like mutant through exposure to FEV, lose everything, then become a wasteland traveler. His journey then took him to the town of Gecko, where he enjoyed a new life. He eventually became an unwilling deity for the Treeminders in the Capital Wasteland, on the opposite end of the continent of where he began.",
    "Harold is a kind-hearted soul with a comical personality. He made many friends throughout his travels, potentially including the Vault Dweller, the Chosen One, and the Lone Wanderer. He is kind to children and the disabled, and treats his branching appendage with respect. Despite his afflictions, Harold remains light-hearted (if somewhat deranged) and strives to do right by his fellow wastelanders.",
    "Born in 2072, Harold was only five years old when the War started and he entered Vault 29.",
    "Thirteen years later, in 2090, he walked out of the Vault in the late morning.",
    "Over the next twelve years, he made a tidy profit, rising to prominence in the Hub as one of its caravan bosses. The position came with many perks, including the friendship of Richard Grey, a doctor whom Harold revered as a brilliant philosopher. A little older than Harold, he made a lasting impression on the caravaner.",
    "By 2102, Harold had enough. He organized one of the first adventuring parties in New California together with Richard Grey, and on May 22, 2102, the expedition launched from the Hub to identify the source of the mutant menace.",
    "Simply getting into the base resulted in major casualties, and by the time the adventurers infiltrated the facility, only four were left.",
    "He was found by traders four days later, on June 27, and taken back to the Hub, where he hoped to find Mark waiting for him. Mark did not come. Harold felt he should return to the wasteland to search for his friend, but he lacked the courage, and lingered in the Hub for decades.",
    "Richard and Harold each believed the other was dead. Harold assumed his friend had perished in the vat. Richard reasoned; \"He must have been killed or he would have tried to help me.\"",
    "Harold in the Hub Old Town.",
    "His resolve, hardiness, and love of the Hub as his home allowed him to survive despite poverty and harassment from regular Hubbers.",
    "Harold left sometime after 2162. He traveled north, accompanied by a sapling (Bob) that took root in his head.",
    "Gecko power plant",
    "By 2238, he arrived in Gecko and decided to help the ghouls there out.",
    "Until someone comes along to mediate between the ghouls and Vault City, Harold is stuck in a holding pattern, processing endless amounts of paperwork and keeping the town in one piece.",
    "Much of this is rooted in the experience of the Unity. Unlike Marcus, who holds a fairly nuanced view of the Master, Harold's view of his former friend - though it's not known if he actually realizes who the Master was - is unconditionally negative. In fact, Harold believes that the Vault Dweller actually saved everyone in the world by defeating the Master, and wonders what happened to his old friend. The last he heard of him, he was kicked out of Vault 13, before disappearing in the mists of history.",
    "After the defeat of the Enclave, he set out once more. The tree growing out of his head continued to grow larger and bear fruit. Its remarkably tough seeds are able to withstand even the toughest environments and thrive.",
    "Harold's tireless legs eventually carried him all the way to the opposite end of the continent, to the Capital Wasteland. Overwhelmed by Bob, he stopped to rest, only to realize that he was unable to move anymore, rooted to the ground by his companion. He became part of the tree, sustained by its photosynthesis and nutrients taken from the ground. He took root in the northern Capital Wasteland and was found by a wanderer in the late 2250s.",
    "With the Treeminders' care and attention, Bob started to take root further; over time, his root system carried away Harold's internal organs far throughout the cave system below, making it plain that short of a merciful death, Harold would remain forever in one spot.",
    "He kept trying, hoping to attract someone capable of helping him through his ordeal. Finally, in 2277, he managed to attract the Lone Wanderer. Upon their acceptance into the cult, Harold requested that they kill him, to spare him the agony of being rooted in one spot for all eternity.",
    "He and Bob genuinely only enjoyed the company of Yew, the youngest of the group, who listened to him without reservation.",
    "Unlike most people who are exposed to FEV, Harold did not become a super mutant, but is the result of a unique combination of radiation damage from constant low-level environmental exposure and contact with FEV, resulting in a hybrid type of species.",
    "The tree growing out of, and eventually, overwhelming Harold, is named Bob. Bob sprouted from Harold's head sometime after his exposure to FEV at the Mariposa Military Base. In the beginning, Bob was a small sprig but its growth accelerated, turning into a full-sized tree, overtaking Harold, and rooting itself to the ground in the Capital Wasteland region.",
    "Harold considers Bob his friend and speaks to him as if he was thinking aloud. Harold will sometimes jokingly refer to Bob as Herbert and makes several comments regarding the literal and figurative closeness of their relationship.",
    "Harold missing an arm.",
    "Harold appears in Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, Fallout Shelter Online and the Fallout: The Board Game add-on Fallout: New California. He was also planned for inclusion in Van Buren, the canceled Fallout 3 by Black Isle Studios, as well as Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2. Photos of Harold appear in The Armageddon Rag, and he would have appeared in Project V13. He was also featured in the Magic: The Gathering crossover event and the Minecraft Mash-up Pack.",
    "With your assistance, Old Harold brings the ghoul population of the Hub into equality with the humans. The two sides work together, and the Hub prospers. Old Harold is still alive, as far as anyone knows.",
    "Harold is a ghoul. He's also a little special.",
    "Super Mutants are humans with no or minimal radiation damage who have been exposed to FEV.",
    "Ghouls are humans with significant radiation damage exposed to FEV.",
