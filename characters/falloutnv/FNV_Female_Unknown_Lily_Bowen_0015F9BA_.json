    "Lillian Marie Bowen, typically truncated to Lily, is a nightkin and former assassin of the Unity, now residing in Jacobstown, where she shepherds the town's bighorner cattle, in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas. She is a possible companion of the Courier.",
    "Born in 2078,",
    "Eventually, after the fall of Unity, the destruction of the Cathedral and the death of the Master, whom she didn't like,",
    "While looking for the remains of her old Vault, she made it as far as the Mojave Wasteland where she relocated to the settlement of Jacobstown, led and watched over by another first-gen super mutant, Marcus. Lily found purpose at Jacobstown as the shepherd of the town's bighorner cattle population.",
    "While living at Jacobstown, she began receiving help from Doctor Henry for her schizophrenia, trying to drown out the voice of \"Leo\" by taking anti-psychotic drugs.",
    "Due to not getting the full dose of anti-psychotics, \"Leo\" continued to manifest in Lily's mind as a malicious deviant and sociopathic voice she can communicate with, giving her instructions in battle and telling her to do \"terrible things.\" ",
    "Despite her hulking appearance as a super-mutant, at her core Lily Bowen is a doting (and somewhat overprotective) grandmother. Her mental instability from long-term exposure to stealth boys has her view most of the wasteland through this lens, such as mistakenly viewing the Courier as one of her grandchildren, and wishing to travel with them to help protect them. However, as opposed to other addled minds in the wastes, she does understand the post-apocalyptic world she inhabits and its history. In particular she recalls her time serving under the Master as a time of discipline in her life.",
    "Lily however suffers from a split personality- with another personality by the name of Uncle Leo encouraging her to act more violently. While under most circumstances she can ignore Uncle Leo's voice, sometimes this personality takes over when she blacks out, fighting much more ferociously and aggressively.",
    "She struggles with her medication regimen, something she feels conflicted over, as she highly values the memories of her grandchildren, and her medication results in memory loss. Depending on player choices, the dosage she chooses to take can wildly effect her personality in the games endings.",
    "\"Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?\"",
    "Additionally, Lily has a third companion weapon, a power fist variant called Lily's gauntlet. This weapon is not initially in Lily's inventory but may be given to her as part of a script that ensures all companions retain their special weapons.",
    "Like all super mutants in New Vegas, Lily is limited in the weapons she can use, and can only equip weapons from the following list. Lily's default assault carbine's high DPS affects which weapons she will equip. There are only two holdout weapons which Lily is capable of using: frag grenades and plasma grenades.",
    "Lily Bowen appears in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "Lily Bowen was written by Travis Stout."
