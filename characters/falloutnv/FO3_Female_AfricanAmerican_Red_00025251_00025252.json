    "Red is on an enforced leave thanks to the current kidnapping sweeps by super mutants in the local area. Her nickname stems from the blood she is always splattered in and her affinity for the color. She runs the clinic in Big Town, and she is the unofficial mayor and an old girlfriend of an older boy named Sticky Hands, an ex-resident of Little Lamplight."
