    "Ranger Pason is an NCR Ranger stationed at Ranger Station Delta in 2281.",
    "Pason is a very professional and rather blunt man.",
    "Like previous ranger reports, one of his was manipulated, falsely attributing the loss of an NCR patrol to enemy action.",
    "Ranger Pason can be killed in a fight with cazadores, but by looting his corpse or robobrain, one can advance the questline of Return to Sender.",
    "The NCR Rangers at the ranger stations, including Pason, were written by additional area designer Matt MacLean, who worked on the quest Return to Sender."
