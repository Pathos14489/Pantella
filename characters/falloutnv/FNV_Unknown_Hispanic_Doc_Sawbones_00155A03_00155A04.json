    "Doc Sawbones is the camp medic in Camp Golf in 2281. He can be found in a tent just next to the trooper tents.",
    "Doc Sawbones is Camp Golf's medical officer and oversees the health of the Rangers and troops. Though he seems very dissatisfied with his position as the camp doctor as troops will come in with the most minor of injuries. In fact, when the player character tells him they are hurt when they have full health, he openly expresses his frustration."
