    "The Drifter is a hostile wastelander who can be found in the Dickerson Tabernacle Chapel in 2277.",
    "The Drifter was once a member of the Treeminders in Oasis, but was exiled long ago for unknown reasons. Scorned and alone in the unforgiving wilderness, the apostate was only able to survive by hunting wildlife and stealing from other wastelanders.",
    "Circa 2277, the Drifter has currently taken up residence in the dilapidated husk of the old Dickerson Tabernacle Chapel.",
    "At some point in the 2280s, he hunted a particular experimental deathclaw which had escaped from Raven Rock. He confronted the creature at Mount Mabel but ultimately left without slaying it.",
    "The Drifter spends his days standing guard on the chapel's top floor attacking anything that gets close.",
    "The Drifter is located on the top floor of the chapel and will attack the player character once they reach the building.",
    "The Drifter appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter Online, and the Magic: The Gathering crossover event.",
    "The name of the \"freeform\" (unmarked) quest associated with him in the Tour of the Capital Wasteland, \"High Plains Drifter,\" is a reference to the 1973 western film of the same name."
