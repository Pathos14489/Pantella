  "description": "Drifter is a 45 year-old African American Male.\n\nA hostile wastelander who has taken up residence in the dilapidated Dickerson Tabernacle Chapel. The Drifter stands guard on the top floor, attacking anyone who approaches.\n\nDrifter's Personality: Bitter, hostile, and solitary. The Drifter is distrustful of others due to his past exile and has adapted to the harsh wasteland environment by becoming aggressive and territorial.\n\nDrifter's Backstory: Once a member of the Treeminders in the peaceful settlement of Oasis, the Drifter was exiled for unknown reasons. Cast out from the only community he knew, he was forced to survive in the unforgiving wilderness. For years, he eked out an existence by hunting wildlife and stealing from other wastelanders. By 2277, he had established himself in the abandoned Dickerson Tabernacle Chapel, where he now lives in self-imposed isolation."
