    "Croatoa is a tribal and one of the inhabitants of Point Lookout in 2277.",
    "Croatoa has been a member of the tribe for some time, as he describes himself as \"not so new\" compared to the Lone Wanderer, who he welcomes upon their acceptance into the tribe.",
    "He possesses a unique shovel that helps him to grow the punga, as it is covered in a fertilizer of some kind.",
    "He can be found wandering inside the outer walls of the Ark & Dove Cathedral, oftentimes tending to the punga.",
    "Croatoa will not become hostile like the unnamed tribals at the cathedral if the Lone Wanderer sides with Desmond during Thought Control, but will still attack if he sees them attacking any other tribals.",
    "With the Child at Heart perk or by passing a Speech check, the Lone Wanderer can get the fertilizer shovel from him.",
    "* Only if the Lone Wanderer has got the fertilizer shovel from him.",
    "Croatoa appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "Croatoan Island is the historical name of Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Most famously, the word \"Croatoan\" was found carved into a tree at the site of the missing Roanoke Colony."
