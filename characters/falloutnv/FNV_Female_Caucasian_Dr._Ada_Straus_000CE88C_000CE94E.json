    "Dr. Ada Straus is a doctor and medical supplies merchant in the town of Novac in 2281.",
    "A merchant and doctor, she and her bodyguards can be found around the gas station behind the Dino Dee-lite Motel. They move periodically, walking around the pack brahmin at the tent and between both road entrances to the town. She offers healing from radiation, addiction removal, and offers a variety of chems for sale. She also sells weapons such as laser pistols and energy cells and components for mass purified water such as dirty water and glass pitchers.",
    "Ada Straus offers the same function as other doctors in the wasteland. However, she does not have any formal medical training,",
    "She states that the money she earns working as a \"doctor\" will be put towards getting real medical training.",
    "Killing her does not result in a loss of Karma but killing her bodyguards does.",
    "According to Joshua Sawyer, although he was unsure who originally came up with Ada Straus as a character, it was likely Eric Fenstermaker who wrote her.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Straus does not have guards, nor does she ever move from outside the large brown tent. She also never unfolds her arms."
