    "Martha Wilson is an inhabitant of Andale in 2277.",
    "Martha is the rather quiet wife of Bill Wilson. If asked her opinion on Andale or other matters, she will be fairly perplexed that someone cared enough to ask.",
    "As part of a family that carries on a tradition of cannibalism as the main way of life in Andale, Martha helps keep the house clean and cooks meals while her husband Bill goes to work with Jack Smith in the aforementioned \"family business.\"",
    "Our Little Secret: Martha is one of Andale's cannibals. Should the Lone Wanderer uncover this secret, upon leaving the shed behind the Smiths' house, the inhabitants of Andale will confront them.",
    "If she is asked about Old Man Harris (after talking to him) she will disclose the fact that he is her father, then states that she \"...probably shouldn't have said that.\""
