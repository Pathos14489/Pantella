    "Anna Holt is a botanist and member of the scientist staff that works under Doctor Madison Li together with Janice Kaplinski on portable fusion power and hydroponics experiments in Fallout 3.",
    "Holt is responsible for the gestation of naturally occurring foodstuffs during her tenure in the Rivet City science lab, where she works under the esteemed Doctor Madison Li.",
    "Furthermore, the distractions from her work by visitors is certainly not helping her less than cheery disposition,",
    "She gladly uprooted and took her research to the Jefferson Memorial with the rest of the laboratory staff when James returned from Vault 112 with the knowledge of how to successfully complete Project Purity. After the team restarted the project with little trouble, she was held hostage with the other scientists by the invading Enclave. While most of the scientists escaped shortly after the altercation, Holt was kidnapped by the Enclave and held captive at Raven Rock.",
    "Astonished by the technological and manufacturing capabilities that the Enclave possessed, she openly told them everything about the staff, project and even how to improve upon the existing design, ensuring its completion and functionality under Enclave control.",
    "She worked very hard to gain the trust of the Enclave and was rewarded with access to their laboratories."
