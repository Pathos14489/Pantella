    "Paladin Hughes, referred to in-game as a Brotherhood of Steel paladin, is a deceased paladin in the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, located in the Black Mountain crater in 2281.",
    "Hughes and fellow Paladin Fairbanks were sent by Elder McNamara to find useful parts for the Hidden Valley bunker at Black Mountain, and to ask the super mutants living there for help. The super mutants turned out to be no help at all, and both Hughes and Fairbanks ultimately wound up dead. Their bodies lie in a crater on the way to the top of the mountain.",
    "There is no actual indication of which paladin is Hughes and which paladin is Fairbanks. The only source for their names is the mission statement CB-03 holotape carried by one of the two."
