    "Mister Lopez is a suicidal resident of Rivet City in the year 2277.",
    "Mister Lopez is a quiet, lonely and severely depressed 65-year-old man. Raiders took the lives of his wife and child, and he came to Rivet City alone and lost. For the past decade, he has been living in the common room of Rivet City. He consumes his meals in the common room and often sleeps for long periods out of sheer depression. He has a daily habit of climbing to the top of the bridge tower and contemplating whether to end his life by jumping.",
    "He regularly visits Saint Monica's Church and spends much of his time reading or praying there. Lopez also attends the weekly church service and receives frequent counseling from Father Clifford, the church priest."
