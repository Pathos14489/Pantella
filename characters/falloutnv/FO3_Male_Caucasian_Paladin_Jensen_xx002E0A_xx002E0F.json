    "Paladin Jensen is a paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel in 2277.",
    "A scout for the Brotherhood of Steel, Jensen is apt to make tactical blunders that put both himself and his teammates in jeopardy. He firmly denies that he's a liability. In fact, he models all his actions on his favorite superhero, Captain Cosmos.",
    "After Broken Steel is loaded, Jensen is held prisoner inside a tent in the Talon Company camp at Fort Bannister. He was sent to scout out Fort Bannister in preparation for a Brotherhood of Steel assault against Talon Company in response to their attacks on Aqua Pura caravans but was found and captured.",
    "Paladin Jensen appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel.",
    "PC Jensen and his squadmates may continue firing at a dead body, and they won't stop even if one disposes/hides the body. "
