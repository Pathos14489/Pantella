    "Mk. III Cyberhound, LEO Support Model, Serial no. B955883, formally known as Rex, is a cyberdog originally from the pre-War era, presently residing with the King in the King's School of Impersonation in Freeside in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas. He is a possible companion of the Courier.",
    "Part German Shepherd, Rex is a \"Cyber-Hound Mk III L.E.O. (Law Enforcement Officer) Support Model\" that has been around since pre-War times. Around 209 years old, he was born as a regular dog",
    "Eventually after leaving Denver and the Legion, the cyberdog ended up in the former state of Nevada and reached the slums of Freeside, where he came under the ownership of the King who loves him dearly. Renamed \"Rex\" (Latin for \"king\"), at the King's side, he showed more of a personality, including traits like how he does not like rats or hats, according to the King, who believes his dislike of hats may come from the fact that \"hat\" rhymes with \"rat.\"",
    "Time has begun to catch up with Rex. By 2281, the cyberdog is suffering from neural degeneration as a result of his aging brain.",
