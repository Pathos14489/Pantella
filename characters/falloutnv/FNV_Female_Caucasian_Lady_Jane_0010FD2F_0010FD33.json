  "description": "Lady Jane is a 38 year-old Caucasian Female.\n\nA weary trader with weathered skin and tired eyes, Lady Jane stands near the entrance to Freeside, just to the right of the gate leading to the New Vegas Strip. Her worn leather armor and patched clothing tell of a difficult life on the road. She carries a worn caravan ledger and keeps a close eye on her few remaining goods, always watching for potential threats in the dangerous wasteland.\n\nLady Jane's Personality: Cautious but not unfriendly, Lady Jane is pragmatic and resourceful. Years of hardship have made her wary of strangers but she maintains a professional demeanor when trading. She speaks with a hint of nostalgia for her California home and shows determination to one day return there, despite the odds against her.\n\nLady Jane's Backstory: Born and raised in the New California Republic, Lady Jane was part of a successful caravan trading family that operated between California and the Mojave Wasteland. In her early twenties, she took over the family business and expanded their routes, eventually establishing regular trade with the New Vegas area. However, disaster struck when her caravan was ambushed and raided in the Broc Flower Cave. The attack left her with most of her inventory destroyed and several of her guards dead. With her savings depleted and her business in ruins, Lady Jane has been struggling to rebuild in Freeside, working odd jobs and small trades while desperately trying to save enough caps to return to California."
