    "Geri is a dog residing in the Calvert Mansion in Point Lookout, acting as a companion of the ghoul Desmond Lockheart. He appears in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "For years, Desmond has had Geri and his other dog Freki, eventually training them to be his attack dogs. Geri was the abused ward of a group of raiders before being saved by Desmond, who later tracked down the raiders and fed them alive to mole rats.",
    "At one point, the dogs chased off Nadine after she wandered too close to the mansion grounds, causing her to stay away when the Point Lookout tribals' latest assault commenced shortly before the Lone Wanderer's arrival on the Duchess Gambit.",
    "Along with Freki, Geri patrols the foyer and stairs of the mansion.",
    "Geri appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout."
