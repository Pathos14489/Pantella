    "Paladin Hoss is a member of the Capital Wasteland chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 3.",
    "Paladin Hoss has taken on the job of conducting training exercises in the field with some of the Brotherhood's initiates, something that he hates almost as much as cleaning the latrines at the Citadel.",
    "By the time the Lone Wanderer arrives in Falls Church, Hoss and the other paladin are continuing to fight the super mutants outside, while Pek is still trapped in the office building. The Lone Wanderer can assist the duo in dispatching the remaining super mutants, which Hoss is grateful for.",
    "If Pek is killed during the rescue operation and the Lone Wanderer had not previously requested a reward, Hoss will be distraught, and feel sympathy for the fallen initiate."
