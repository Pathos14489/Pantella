    "Paladin Kodiak, born Greg Bear is a member of the elite Lyons' Pride of the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 3.",
    "Among Lyons Pride and the chapter in general, Paladin Kodiak is the single largest and strongest of its fighters. He is the unit's \"jack of all trades\": He does not excel at any single task like a specialist would, but is capable enough to perform any thing the sentinel needs, from recon, through demolition, to tactical assaults.",
    "However, he is also among the most laid back members of the Pride whenever he's not busy swinging his powered sledgehammer around. Other members of the Pride, like Knight Captain Dusk (affectionately nicknamed Dusky by Kodiak) are somewhat put off by his sociability, especially when he's supposed to be preparing for an assault. Kodiak shrugs off their reservations, joking that he was born ready, for anything, and that he's just that awesome.",
    "His attitude developed in spite of his traumatic childhood. It was spent in the violent Pitt, surrounded by trogs, rapists, murderers and hellish pollution. Kodiak never knew his parents and remembers his childhood as mostly surviving on the streets and fighting rats for food:",
    "Although he lost his blood brothers, he gained a new family within the Brotherhood. Together with about twenty other kids",
    "He can be found around the great hall in the A ring area of the Citadel.",
    "Kodiak is nicknamed after the Kodiak bear, one of the largest species of bear in the world."
