    "Silas is a slaver stationed at the Lincoln Memorial in 2277.",
    "Leroy's right-hand man and trusted second-in-command, Silas guards the slavers' current defensive stronghold against the almost constant super mutant attacks. Curt, sly, and sardonic, Silas isn't a particularly pleasant man, even for a slaver.",
    "Leroy Walker and his slaver comrades, including Silas, were sent to the Lincoln Memorial by Eulogy Jones just in case any escaped slaves would want to pay homage to \"the great emancipator.\"",
    "Silas remains in the game files of Fallout: New Vegas as legacy content. He has the distinction of being the only named human non-player character to have been left in the files."
