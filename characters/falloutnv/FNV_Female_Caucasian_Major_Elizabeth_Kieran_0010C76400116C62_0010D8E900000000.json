    "Major Elizabeth Kieran is a member of the New California Republic Army's supply corps. She is providing aid to NCR squatters living in Freeside in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Major Kieran is leading a mission to provide food to citizens of the New California Republic who live in Freeside. As a member of the NCR Army's supply corps, Kieran has been giving handouts to proven NCR citizens, but has been running into trouble with local Freesiders.",
    "She would like to have friendly relations with the Kings, as shown by her willingness to send an emissary, but men like Pacer have prevented this from happening.",
    "Major Kieran is a friend of Julie Farkas, and she is the reason why Kieran likes the Followers of the Apocalypse, unlike many others in the NCR who do not see eye-to-eye with the group.",
    "G.I. Blues: She will tell the Courier about her current mission. If the Courier speaks to Julie Farkas at the Old Mormon Fort beforehand, Major Kieran is willing to provide more information about her mission, including details about the failed envoy which can be used to peacefully resolve matters between the Kings and the NCR. Otherwise, when the situation escalates, Kieran and her troopers must be killed."
