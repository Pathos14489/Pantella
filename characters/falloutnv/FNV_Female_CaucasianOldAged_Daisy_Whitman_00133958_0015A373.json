    "Daisy Whitman is a former Enclave Vertibird pilot living in Novac in 2281.",
    "An Enclave veteran and citizen, back when the oil rig and Navarro were still flying familiar colors, Daisy was a pilot assigned to a squad under the command of Captain Judah Kreger. Piloting the great flying machines left an indelible mark on her personality, becoming her truest passion. Being in the Enclave mattered little, what was important was being able to taste freedom while airborne. She loved it so much that she was willing to risk her standing by taking the scenic route back to Navarro each time she flew on a mission.",
    "Flying over 71 missions, she suffered only a single Vertibird loss, walking away from a crash in Klamath that claimed the lives of her two fellow crew members.",
    "Her career ended when the Chosen One destroyed the oil rig in 2242 and the sacking of Navarro by the New California Republic. Judah Kreger, Orion Moreno, Cannibal Johnson, and a young Arcade Gannon with his mother left Navarro, at first heading south into the NCR. There they tried to integrate into Republic's society but were forced to flee east as the NCR cracked down on Enclave members living in their lands.",
    "Daisy kept in contact with Arcade, becoming like a mother to him after both ended up settling in the Mojave Wasteland. She found a measure of happiness as a scavenger and by 2281 is living in Novac, helping prospectors take apart engines and isolate parts worth reselling.",
    "Daisy Whitman and the rest of the Enclave remnants were written by Jeff Husges, who was the designer on the quest For Auld Lang Syne, based on concepts by Joshua Sawyer. Sawyer gave the characters their names.",
    "Daisy is able to detect the player character from anywhere in her apartment, even when she should not be able to, such as while sleeping, facing the other direction or in a different room. However, it may still be possible to steal some items by crouching and almost simultaneously stealing the item."
