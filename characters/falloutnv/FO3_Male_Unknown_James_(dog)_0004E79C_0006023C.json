    "James, also known as Dad, is the father of the Lone Wanderer and Vault 101's physician in Fallout 3.",
    "James was always an inquisitive, meticulous and determined man; this personality led him to form or join a group of like-minded scientists, who were set on changing the wasteland for the better. Before the Lone Wanderer was born, James led an ambitious scientific endeavor known as Project Purity.",
    "Under the protection of the Brotherhood of Steel, research was well underway when Catherine and James discovered they were expecting a child.",
    "Before the project could reach fruition, Catherine delivered their child but passed away due to complications of childbirth.",
    "Escorted by the Brotherhood's Star Paladin Cross, James pressed onward with his child, traveling across the D.C. ruins to Vault 101. Along the way, James and Cross also stayed at the saloon in Megaton owned by Colin Moriarty briefly.",
    "After successfully reaching and entering the large underground vault, James began his service as the vault's new physician. Soon after he took up residence, his research into Project Purity began again, this time consisting of sneaking into the restricted areas of the vault each night, searching for anything relevant or helpful towards the project aims.",
    "The information regarding this piece of technology was completely foreign to James, who mentioned that it seemed as if it were nothing short of a miracle.",
    "Years passed and James continued to serve as the vault's physician, all the while caring for his child as they progressed through each stage of their childhood and young adulthood.",
    "In the morning hours of August 17, 2277, James left the vault and returned to the surface. His assistant and friend Jonas who helped him escape was killed. The act of leaving the vault caused a crisis within, and the overseer considered the Lone Wanderer complicit in their father's plans. James made his way to Megaton, Galaxy News Radio, and then the GNR building plaza, meeting with old acquaintances Colin Moriarty and Three Dog along the way. His old friends encouraged him onwards, and he decided that he would need Dr. Madison Li to join the project once more if he hoped to see it through.",
    "James tracked Madison's whereabouts to Rivet City, and approached her with a request to join forces once again.",
    "Undeterred, James traversed to Vault 112 in hopes of tracking down Braun or his research. There was still a study being undertaken, but it was not what James anticipated. Braun was engaged in research revolving around the oversight of several families trapped in virtual reality pods in a simulation entitled Tranquility Lane. James, unaware of these plans, became ensnared in Braun's trap as well. Braun turned James into a dog within the sim, unable to communicate with anyone else in a recognizable way.",
    "James' child had followed him to Vault 112 and into the sim, and was able to break the two of them free from its trap.",
    "As James had hoped, information about the GECK was enough to convince Madison of the project's continued viability.",
    "Shortly after James and Madison began work once more on the project, a large Enclave force arrived at the Jefferson Memorial. Soldiers under the command of Colonel Autumn stormed the activation room where the scientists were working. Autumn declared the Enclave was taking over the project and demanded James turn over all materials related to this project. James assured the colonel that the facility was not operational and never had been, so taking over it would be a waste of their efforts.",
    "Autumn, losing patience, executed one of the scientists, Janice, and repeated his demand for James to immediately hand over all materials related to the project and aid the Enclave in making the purifier operational at once. James instead caused a radiation leak in the control room, killing everyone inside except Autumn. James collapsed and died, telling his child to run with his last words.",
    "James appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter as a legendary vault dweller, and Fallout Shelter Online. A photograph of him appears in Fallout: New Vegas."
