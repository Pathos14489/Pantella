    "Chomps Lewis is the foreman of the Quarry Junction mining operation for the New California Republic in the Mojave Wasteland, recently forced out by an infestation of deathclaws and sheltering in the nearby worker town of Sloan in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Around the turn of the 2280s, Chomps was employed by the New California Republic as the head foreman of the limestone quarry at Quarry Junction; the material mined there was subsequently sent to a concrete mixing yard near Boulder City with the finished product ultimately going to constructing fortifications for NCR Army positions in their war against Caesar's Legion.",
    "However, around late October 2281, the quarry workers found themselves in a difficult situation when members of the Powder Gangers, formed in the wake of the mass breakout at the NCR Correctional Facility to the south, attacked and in the process stole their entire supply of dynamite.",
    "Due to the losses in manpower and work justifying pay due to the quarry's shutdown, Chomps has only been able to keep his men around by operating on the side as a middleman distributing drug shipments for the Great Khans;",
    "Outside of his private affairs, Chomps also has a low opinion of the republic's current state in the 23rd century, particularly his employer's insistence on paying its workers in dollars instead of caps which he sees as unfair due to NCR currency's unpopularity out on the frontier but knows that it is a necessary evil to make a living."
