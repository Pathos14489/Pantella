    "The recon craft Theta pilot is a dead alien found at the alien crash site.",
    "This alien was sent by the mothership, Zeta, to scout Earth with its ship, Theta. The pilot ended up fatally crashing in the Capital Wasteland in 2277.",
    "The pilot can be found at the alien crash site. To get to the site, go to the MDPL-13 power station, and follow the power lines north until the alien distress signal is picked up. The signal is called the recon craft Theta signal on the Pip-Boy. It can be followed to the site as it will get louder and clearer as the Lone Wanderer gets closer. The Pip-Boy will indicate higher radiation levels as the Lone Wanderer gets closer to the crash site."
