    "Lieutenant Gorobets is an NCR Army officer in charge of First Recon's Alpha Team, stationed at Camp McCarran in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "As his name suggests, Gorobets is descended from a family of Ukrainians who immigrated to America in centuries past.",
    "At the present, he is stuck at Camp McCarran, coordinating sniper teams that hold the Fiends at bay. His only problem is the absence of people \"brave\" enough out to lure prominent Fiend leaders like Driver Nephi out from hiding.",
    "Lieutenant Gorobets appears in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare."
