    "Tara Fields was a mercenary working for Allistair Tenpenny. She was killed in Fort Constantine, sometime before the events of 2277.",
    "Tara was one of five mercenaries hired by Allistair Tenpenny to infiltrate Fort Constantine and retrieve an experimental suit of armor. Reports were that she was mauled by feral ghouls, but in reality, she reached the last chamber but lacked the key to unlock the door. She was shot by a robobrain, where her body remains to this day.  She was the only member of the team to die in the mission."
