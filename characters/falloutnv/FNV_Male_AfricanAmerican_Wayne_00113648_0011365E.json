    "Wayne is one of the three Freesiders that were attacked by NCR soldiers in 2281 preceding the quest G.I. Blues, along with his friends Roy and Farris.",
    "Wayne is a scavenger in Freeside. He, Roy and Farris just cashed in some scrap metal and decided to go to the Atomic Wrangler to try their luck at gambling when an attack occurred between two parties and they were caught in the crossfire. Wayne is a proud local, and isn't afraid to stand up to \"big guys\" to prove it.",
    "Asking him if he is holding anything from the Courier will result in losing Freeside fame, one of the very few times in the game where fame/infamy is lost. Alternatively, thanking him will result in gaining Freeside fame. In either case, Wayne will give you information and the quest progresses the same."
