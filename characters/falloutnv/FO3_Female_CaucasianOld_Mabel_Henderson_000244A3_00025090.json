    "Mabel Henderson is one of the inhabitants of Vault 112 trapped in the Tranquility Lane virtual reality simulation, met in Fallout 3.",
    "A resident of Vault 112 for over 200 years,",
    "However, they also recognize her as a prime source of news on what's going on in Tranquility Lane. This earns Mabel the scorn of some: Pat Neusbaum distrusts and dislikes Mabel both for being a busybody,",
    "Martha Simpson is Mabel's closest friend and confidante. The one issue on which they disagree is robotics: While Martha is an enthusiast of robots, Mabel dislikes them. Though she has a Mister Handy at home, she feels uncomfortable in its presence, feeling watched and unsafe. If she wasn't reliant on it for house chores, she'd rather get rid of it - completely, rather than picking something out of the \"new\" RobCo catalogue, as Martha suggested.",
    "By 2277, Henderson's vitals indicate a state of deep contentment: 82 beats per minute, 110/70 mmHg of blood pressure, 98.3°F/36.8°C temperature, 13 breaths per minute, and nominal stress levels.",
    "Mabel starting her oven, in one of the \"creative\" ways to kill her."
