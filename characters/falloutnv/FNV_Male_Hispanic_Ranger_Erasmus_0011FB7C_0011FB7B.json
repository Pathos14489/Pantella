    "Ranger Erasmus is an NCR Ranger and the commander of Ranger Station Echo in 2281.",
    "As the commanding officer of Echo, Erasmus leads the NCR's military effort in the area. At the present, they are inactive, limiting their activity to surveillance of Cottonwood Cove, as they have too few Rangers at their disposal. Caesar's Legion mostly runs skirmishes against the rangers, but the legionaries usually fall back when they realize who they are facing.",
    "If approached, he may exchange dialogue with the Courier relating to the outpost's mission.",
    "The NCR Rangers at the ranger stations, including Erasmus, were written by additional area designer Matt MacLean, who worked on the quest Return to Sender."
