    "Dennis Crocker is the ambassador to New Vegas for the New California Republic in 2281. His full title, according to the note written to the Courier, is \"Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary\" of the Department of State.",
    "Ambassador Crocker began his political career as a mayor more than 20 years ago in NCR, and worked his way up through the ranks. He was the head of Kimball's campaign for his successful run for NCR council, which he attributes to why he has his current position. Crocker is a strong believer in diplomacy and hopes to unite the Mojave Wasteland under the NCR peacefully. However, his work has made very little progress since Mr. House refused to even meet him in person after signing the New Vegas Treaty.",
    "Ambassador Crocker is the third successor of the title of ambassador to the Strip following Susanna Edith and Phillip Granger, and is in his seventh year of ambassadorship.",
    "When leaving the Lucky 38 for the first time, the Courier will receive a letter from Crocker delivered by an NCR trooper. In the letter, he requests that they come to speak with him at the NCR Embassy, agreeing to pardon them of any crimes they may have committed against the NCR up to that point."
