    "Godfrey is a Mister Handy that can become the Lone Wanderer's personal robot butler in the Tenpenny Tower suite in 2277.",
    "For those discerning types, choosing the right robotic butler is simply a matter of class. Enter Godfrey, the perfect mechanized butler, with many exciting features, such as water purification, follicle-shortening, and just the right type of mirth programming. To wit: \"I was going to the clairvoyance meeting, but it was canceled due to unforeseen events.\" Your perfect plastic pal is fun to be with.",
    "Godfrey stays in the Lone Wanderer's Tenpenny tower suite at all times, randomly moving around.",
    "The joke, \"Two cannibals are eating a clown. One turns to the other and says, 'Does this taste funny to you?'\" was also told by a servant robot named 'Andrew' (Robin Williams) in the movie Bicentennial Man, and is originally by Tommy Cooper."
