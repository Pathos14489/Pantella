    "Matilda West was an inhabitant of Arefu in 2277.",
    "Prior to the incident that left both her and her husband Davis dead, Matilda had lived in Arefu for over ten years with her husband, son Ian and daughter Lucy, though Lucy had recently left to make it on her own in the town of Megaton. Matilda was responsible for cleaning out the village outhouse, a task which falls to Ken Ewers after her demise.",
    "Although Lucy had been aware of Ian’s craving and had helped him ward it off for some time before her departure, neither Ian nor Lucy ever told their parents about the issue, having felt that neither of them would understand.",
    "Matilda West is the wife of Davis West and mother of Ian and Lucy West.",
    "Blood Ties: Matilda is found dead when the Lone Wanderer searches the Wests' house. Her or her husband's body can be examined to find out the cause of their deaths. With a Medicine skill of 30 and above, it is revealed they were bitten on the neck, and that the bite goes all the way to the bone. Later on, it becomes clear Ian was the one who killed both his parents."
