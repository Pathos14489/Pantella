    "Ted Gunderson is a character found in the Ultra-Luxe casino in 2281.",
    "Ill-mannered and entitled, he is the son of notorious brahmin baron Heck Gunderson. While accompanying his father to the Ultra-Luxe, Ted Gunderson was mistakenly kidnapped by the faction of the White Glove Society loyal to Mortimer, who intended to serve him at a special dinner designed to convert the society to cannibalism. He can be found in the Ultra-Luxe kitchens.",
    "When Ted's identity is discovered, however, Mortimer voices his new unwillingness to serve Ted, and requests the Courier to find a new \"main course\" to continue on with their plan. Mortimer also gives the Courier the option of killing Ted and framing his father for the murder."
