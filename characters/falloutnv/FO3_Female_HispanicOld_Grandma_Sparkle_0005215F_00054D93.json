    "Grandma Sparkle is a trader and cook residing at Wilhelm's Wharf in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3.",
    "Coming to inhabit the wharf sometime around 2277, despite recent super mutant and raider incursions, Sparkle has refused to leave her encampment at the wharf, protecting her claim through her skill with a hunting rifle and the support of her family, who frequently go out searching for mirelurk meat.",
    "Sometimes, Grandma Sparkle may start wearing the motorcycle helmet that is usually found in the fridge next to where she is usually leaning against."
