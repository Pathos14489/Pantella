    "Manny Vargas is a former Great Khan who is a veteran NCR Army sniper living in Novac in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Born and raised in North Vegas, Manny once ran with the Great Khans",
    "The good run lasted until the Bitter Springs Massacre. Both Manny and Craig were stationed at Camp Golf at the time. Knowing he would have to face his former comrades, Manny faked an illness and stayed back in camp. He is not clear on what happened, just that a lot of people died and many of them did not want to be a part of the fighting at all. Although he harbors no ill will towards the Army, blaming only the chaos of the battlefield for the massacre, it made it impossible for him to continue serving. The fact that people would sometimes call him a murderer to his face when they secured a Mojave town did not help.",
    "Manny and Craig took their papers and left to find a new life in the wasteland. Manny convinced his friend to settle at Novac, where their rifles could do some good.",
    "When Carla was abducted by the Legion, Craig came to his friend to confide in him, but Manny failed to hide his satisfaction at her disappearance. The grieving husband could not take this kind of reaction from his best friend and turned his back on him. Although Manny hoped Craig would come around, Boone did not. Instead, he disappeared from Novac, eventually returning grim, cold and a shell of a man.",
    "Manny was left without a friend in Novac. He was widely respected for his role as a sniper and leadership in security matters, but although people look up to him and depend on him, nobody really cares about his feelings.",
    "Manny was Craig Boone's closest friend ever since their time in First Recon, although their friendship was tested by Carla and her personality. When he later lost his friend's trust, Manny also lost his closest confidante and the only person who seemed to understand what he felt.",
    "Although he is no longer a member of the Great Khans, he is still loyal to them and helps them when they are in need, proving the doubters wrong."
