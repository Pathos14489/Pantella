    "Fitz sells food to any travelers that decide to stop by. He sells a small number of various foods such as radroach meat and iguana bits.",
    "Not Worth a Hill of Corn and Beans: Fitz is one of the three meat suppliers for Camp McCarran on Farber's list. He can be convinced to trade with McCarran either by being told he'll be paid in caps, or by being persuaded to trade in exchange for vegetables via a Speech 60 check or a Barter 60 check. Either skill check results in a larger reward than the former option."
