    "Boxcars is a member of the Powder Gangers and one of the few survivors of the massacre of Nipton carried out by Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Like many of the Powder Gangers, Boxcars is a former convict from the NCR Correctional Facility who escaped during the mass breakout orchestrated by Samuel Cooke in 2281 and joined Eddie's newly formed Powder Gangers. Boxcars was among the group who were in Nipton on the day Vulpes Inculta and the forces of the Legion captured the town's population, including the locals, the Powder Gangers, and members of the New California Republic Army; the gangsters had been tricked by Nipton's mayor Joseph B. Steyn into plotting to capture and ransom the soldiers, but in reality it was to lure them in so they would be vulnerable to the Legion.",
    "With their assembled captives, the Legion instituted a \"lottery\" where everyone received a ticket determining their fate and then the Legion would carry them out.",
    "After the executions were finished, the remaining victims received their non-lethal but arguably worse fates. Some surviving Powder Gangers were enslaved and taken by the Legion.",
    "When first speaking with him, Boxcars will demand a supply of Med-X to deal with the pain from his crippled legs. Depending on the number of doses given, the player character receives a moderate amount of Karma gain though this will not affect one's reputation with the Powder Gangers. He can be given Med-X in amounts of one (+20 Karma), two (+30 Karma), three (+40 Karma), or five (+50 Karma), but only one option can be chosen per transaction."
