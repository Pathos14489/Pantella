    "Cerberus is a Mister Gutsy defending the Underworld, a major ghoul settlement  in Fallout 3.",
    "Painstakingly maintained by Winthrop, Cerberus is a Mister Gutsy living up to his name as the guardian of the Underworld. Or rather, guard dog, defending from threats foreign and domestic. He's keenly aware of the irony.",
    "Cerberus is very adept at masking his self-awareness. He only speaks normally when speaking to outsiders. Winthrop receives the driest of status reports, to the point of malicious compliance, such as claiming he cannot parse his commands when Winthrop tries to chat.",
    "He isn't far off the mark; Cerberus is ancient. Its systems are old and worn, and whenever Winthrop runs diagnostics (using code 662-847-B), Cerberus spits out a multi-level diagnostic that consistently returns numerous errors including low ammo levels in unit 2B, fluctuating contact in his cognition system with no known source of failure, constant target recognition system failures, and class two failures in its locomotion systems, with a 47% probability of graduating to a class one failure. Winthrop tries to keep on top of the repairs, but he prioritizes keeping the Underworld from falling apart, and most of the time Cerberus goes without maintenance. The noisy, old Mister Gutsy just patrols the concourse endlessly, with tech reports just piling up and Winthrop constantly promising to take him offline for repairs for later. It's likely the unaddressed cognition system failures are responsible for his self-awareness, much like Sawbones' damage due to a generator overload was.",
    "Cerberus patrols the entire Underworld concourse using an 11 marker route, 24 hours a day.",
    "Cerberus (Κέρβερος) is a mythical creature from Greek mythology, with three heads and sometimes portrayed with a serpentine tail and snakes protruding from its body. Cerberus was placed by Hades at the gates of the Underworld, to protect them against trespassers and escapees. This Mister Gutsy parallels it not just by being a guard dog, but also having three eyes (heads) and three arms (snakes)."
