    "Milo, also known as Milo, shipping foreman is a Mister Handy at the Nuka-Cola plant in 2277. He is located at the bottom level of the factory floor near the upper door to the offices.",
    "Milo is a Mister Handy robot that was made before the Great War to keep an eye on production in the bottling area of the Nuka-Cola plant. As the latest in robotic bookkeeping and shipment launching, Milo continues to be a proud employee of the Nuka-Cola Corporation centuries after it went out of business. Currently, he is waiting for additional shipping instructions from a Nuka-Cola employee with proper ID.",
    "At some point shortly before the Great War, Milo went rogue and became violent with employees found to be violating company policy. A locked closet with four bodies can be found in the plant, with a note revealing that Milo left them to starve to death for minor infractions, such as leaving the toilet seat up in the unisex bathrooms or having a slightly longer lunch break than they were permitted.",
    "Failing the Speech checks to get the research department safe key results in demerits, and most of the remaining options will also produce the same effect. Upon receiving three demerits, Milo will become hostile, and the key can be looted from his body afterward.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 An error can occur when the player character meets Milo and he will only say \"What is it now, sir/ma'am?\". The dialogue will automatically end and one cannot interact with him. He can still be destroyed and looted, however."
