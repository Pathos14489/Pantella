    "Sergeant Kilborn is an Army non-commissioned officer stationed at the New California Republic's border outpost in the Mojave Wasteland. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Since he joined the NCR Army, Kilborn has seen his fair share of war and politics, enough to give him a rather cynical perspective on life. After being posted to the republic's Mojave Outpost prior to 2281, serving as protectors of the gateway between New California and the Mojave, being left to watch over the endless stretches of desert has done little to improve his spirits."
