    "Patchwork, or \"Patches,\" is a ghoul who resides in the city of Underworld in Fallout 3.",
    "Patchwork is the resident drunk of Underworld, drinking to a point where he consistently slurs his words and has a tendency to forget what is being said to him mid-conversation.",
    "He is in a poor physical state and is prone to losing body parts that Doctor Barrows has to both locate and subsequently sew back on, almost like a \"patchwork.\"",
    "Patchwork can be heard singing \"Bugger off, ye bastards bugger off... ye'll get nae more this evenin'\" which is the beginning of the Irish drinking song 'Bugger Off,' though he forgets the remaining lyrics.",
    "Patchwork randomly wanders around the promenade inside the center area of Underworld. He may enter The Ninth Circle to obtain more alcohol. He and Quinn appear to be good friends, as in a non-player character to non-player character conversation Patchwork asks Quinn if he \"brought anything back\" for him.",
    "Patchwork will tell you to \"talk to Ahzrukhal\" even if Ahzrukhal is already dead."
