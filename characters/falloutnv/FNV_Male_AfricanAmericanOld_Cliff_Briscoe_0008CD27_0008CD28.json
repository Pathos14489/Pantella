He has a pragmatic approach to life in the Mojave Wasteland, focusing on making a living while maintaining good relationships with the locals. He's not particularly adventurous but is generally helpful to those who treat him with respect.\n\nCliff Briscoe's Backstory: Cliff Briscoe grew up in the wasteland and has spent most of his life in and around Novac. Before establishing the Dino Bite gift shop, he worked various odd jobs around the town, eventually saving enough to purchase the small gift shop from its previous owner.
