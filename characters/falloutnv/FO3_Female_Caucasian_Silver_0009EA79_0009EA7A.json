    "Sara Silver is a former citizen of Megaton hiding out within Springvale's only habitable building, the small ranch, in 2277.",
    "Silver was a prostitute who worked for Colin Moriarty in Megaton before they had a falling out and she ran off with her share of her earnings (or so she says), deciding to hide out in Springvale.",
    "She told Moriarty that she was done hooking and was taking the caps she had earned fair and square; she even slept with him to seal the deal. The next morning Moriarty told her she could not leave, but she grabbed her caps and ran for it."
