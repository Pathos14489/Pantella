  "description": "Dr. Aris Thorne is a 180 year-old Human (ghoulified) Female.\n\nA former pre-War scientist who survived the Great War as a ghoul, Dr. Thorne has transformed the SatCom Array NW-05a into her personal laboratory. Obsessed with revenge against humanity for the apocalypse she witnessed, she has dedicated her unnaturally long life to harnessing pre-War technology for destructive purposes.\n\nDr. Aris Thorne's Personality: Bitter, vengeful, and highly intelligent. Dr. Thorne is methodical in her research but paranoid about intruders. She harbors deep resentment toward humans despite being one herself before ghoulification. She values precision and results above all else, showing little empathy for those who stand in her way.\n\nDr. Aris Thorne's Backstory: Born in 1897, Dr. Aris Thorne was a promising physicist working on military satellite technology before the Great War. When the bombs fell in 2077, she was exposed to massive amounts of radiation while working at a government facility. Instead of dying, she ghoulified, a fate she considers worse than death. For 200 years, she wandered the wasteland, collecting knowledge and resources while harboring an ever-growing resentment toward humanity. By 2277, she had amassed a significant fortune in bottle caps and used it to establish her base at the abandoned SatCom Array, where she resumed her research with a new, vengeful purpose."
