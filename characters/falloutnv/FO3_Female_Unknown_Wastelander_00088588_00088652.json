    "The wastelander is a female ghoul scientist who works in the SatCom Array NW-05a in 2277.",
    "This resident of the Capital Wasteland is an intelligent, ghoulified researcher with the goal of tapping into a pre-War military satellite in orbit with the goal of getting revenge on the human inhabitants of the wasteland for causing the Great War 200 years ago.",
    "To that end, she set up a base at SatCom Array NW-05a and hired mercenaries from Talon Company to protect the premises. She used a stash of bottle caps she had been collecting since well before most of the mercenaries were born.",
    "However, the wastelander soon struck gold: she successfully pinged Highwater Trousers, an orbital nuclear weapons platform.",
    "As soon as the Lone Wanderer enters the building she will begin to flee, meaning that they cannot speak with her.",
    "She cannot be enslaved via the Mesmetron, and instead will frenzy on the Talon Company mercs and the Lone Wanderer."
