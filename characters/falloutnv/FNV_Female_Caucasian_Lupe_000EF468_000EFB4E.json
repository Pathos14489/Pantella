  "description": "Lupe is a 38 year-old Caucasian Female.\n\nLupe is the co-owner of the Grub n' Gulp, a rest stop along the I-15 in the Mojave Wasteland. As a water vendor, she sells both purified and dirty water, often making the darkly humorous comment that 'a little fallout never killed anyone.'\n\nLupe's Personality: Pragmatic and darkly humorous, Lupe has adapted to the harsh realities of the wasteland. She's business-minded but maintains a casual, somewhat cynical attitude toward life in the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nLupe's Backstory: Lupe grew up in the wasteland, learning to survive from a young age. She eventually met Fitz, and together they established the Grub n' Gulp as a way to provide essential supplies to travelers along the I-15. While not officially aligned with any major faction, Lupe generally supports the New California Republic's presence in the Mojave, seeing them as a stabilizing force in the region."
