    "Philip Lem is a Powder Ganger living in Vault 19 in 2281.",
    "Philip Lem made his living by sneaking into NCR camps and stealing goods and made a well enough living. One day, however, he got sloppy and got caught, avoided hanging, and sent to NCR Correctional Facility.",
    "Lem decided to follow Cooke's lead on the way out of NCRCF and to Vault 19 but after all was said and done, Lem began to think that the group should turn themselves in back to the NCR believing that the group can't sustain themselves on the limited resources they got",
    "Why Can't We Be Friends?: After planting the C-4 on the microcline rock, Philip asks the Courier to talk to Papa Khan to secure their alliance.",
    "Phillip Lem's name is derived from the science-fiction writers Phillip K. Dick and Stanisław Lem. Sydney Wolfram, who designed Vault 19, was reading from both authors at the time."
