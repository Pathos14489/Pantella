    "Specialist Olin is a member of the Brotherhood Outcasts at their outpost at Bailey's Crossroads in the Capital Wasteland housing the Anchorage Reclamation simulation. She appears in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "Like all of the Outcasts, Olin once swore loyalty to the Capital Wasteland chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel led by Elder Owyn Lyons. She was one of those who disagreed with \"old man Lyons\" over his disobedience to the West Coast elders, and she ultimately joined Henry Casdin and other hardliners in their schism, splintering off into the Outcasts.",
    "Sometime prior to 2277, the now-Specialist Olin joined the group led by Protector McGraw in taking over the pre-War Virtual Strategic Solutions facility within the ruins of Washington D.C. Olin's technical expertise earned her the role of maintaining and running the facility's technology suite, including a fully virtual simulation recreating the events of the Battle of Anchorage.",
    "In her efforts to unlock the armory, Olin discovered that it was tied to the completion of the Anchorage Reclamation simulation, and that the simulation required both a neural interface suit and an external interface like a Pip-Boy. Despite her attempts, she was unable to bypass it.\nThis grisly and ultimately fruitless decision has earned her the derision of Defender Sibley.",
    "Olin appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "Outcast members Sibley, Olin, McGraw and Morrill, all of whom are added in Operation: Anchorage, appear to be named after buildings on the campus of Cornell University, including Sibley Hall, Olin Hall, Olin Library, McGraw Hall, McGraw Tower, and Morrill Hall."
