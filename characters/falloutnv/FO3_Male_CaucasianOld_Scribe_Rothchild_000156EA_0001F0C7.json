    "Reginald Rothchild is the senior scribe of the Brotherhood of Steel in 2277.",
    "Scribe Rothchild is in charge of the scribes of the Brotherhood of Steel in the Capital Wasteland,",
    "Despite that, Rothchild was a part of Star Paladin Owyn Lyons' expedition to Washington, D.C. in 2255.",
    "Success proved elusive in his own project as well. Despite intense efforts, Rothchild and the rest of his team failed to reactivate Liberty Prime for over twenty years. As he worked on Liberty Prime, he observed the steady deterioration of the chapter under Lyons' leadership and the changes introduced to their mission.\nEspecially after Lyons' insubordination led to the West cutting the D.C. bunker loose, denying them reinforcements and shutting off communications,",
    "In this situation, the conflict with the Enclave seemed like a death knell for the chapter. However, with the arrival of Madison Li, Rothchild decided to continue his work in a last-ditch attempt at reactivating Liberty Prime.",
    "When the Enclave finally managed to destroy Liberty Prime by luring him to their satellite relay station in Rockland, Rothchild was heartbroken. The loss set the chapter back years and removed their only significant advantage over the Enclave, which remained a potent threat even with the loss of the purifier and Raven Rock.",
    "After the fall of Adams AFB, Rothchild returned to his roots, starting work on rebuilding Liberty Prime. Although the task was daunting, requiring immense amounts of salvage to restore its complex systems, especially electrical components and optics, he rose to the challenge.",
    "He can usually be found in the Citadel laboratory.",
    "Reginald Rothchild appears in Fallout 3, its add-on Broken Steel, Fallout Shelter, Fallout Shelter Online, and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare."
