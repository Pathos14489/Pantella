    "Jacklyn is a wastelander residing near Nipton in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "At some point in her life, Jacklyn heard the story about the secret value of Sunset Sarsaparilla star bottle caps and the \"treasure\" they were tied to, and started collecting them, to the degree that she's willing to lie, steal, and murder anyone she suspects of having even one, much like another infamous star-cap hunter, Allen Marks.",
    "Sometime around October 2281, Jacklyn met Tomas and offered to travel with him. Unbeknownst to Tomas, who thought she was friendly company, Jacklyn suspected him of carrying some star bottle caps, which was later confirmed when he showed off his \"lucky\" star-cap necklace, resulting in Jacklyn attacking him outside of Nipton shortly before the Courier arrives."
