    "Mad Johnny Wes is a heavily armed, hostile wastelander and the only human occupant of Hubris Comics in Fallout 3.",
    "Johnny was trapped inside Hubris Comics due to the nearby presence of a super mutant group in the Mason District. He was almost killed by an onslaught of feral ghouls inside the building but has managed to defend himself by utilizing a minigun as well as automated turrets and improvised traps, coordinating the effort from a fortified foreman's office that he has nicknamed \"the Alamo.\" However, the difficult situation has put a strain on Johnny and caused him to lose his mind, turning him hostile towards any wastelanders who approach his position.",
    "Mad Johnny is a nod to Wes Johnson, a prominent voice actor in Bethesda games, who also voices Mister Burke. However, Johnson himself does not voice the character, who instead uses generic combat dialogue voiced by Johnny Contino."
