    "Laszlo Radford is a wastelander roaming the Capital Wasteland in 2277. He appears in Fallout 3.",
    "Little to nothing is known about Laszlo's past, including how he first came to be affiliated with Sam Warrick; for unknown reasons, Warrick developed a one-sided rivalry with Radford, whereas Radford considers him a friend.",
    "By 2277, Laszlo freely roams the Capital Wasteland searching for intact copies of Grognak the Barbarian comic books. Recently, he acquired a railway rifle that he uses to make a sport out of beheading feral ghouls with railway spikes.",
    "Laszlo is noted to be highly bloodthirsty, and described as \"a madman who fights first, fights again, and then thinks for a bit afterward.\"",
    "Laszlo Radford only appears in a random encounter after the player character obtains at least one schematic for the railway rifle. He is always hostile and attacks on sight.",
    "On Laszlo's body, one will find two sets of leather armor including the one he has equipped."
