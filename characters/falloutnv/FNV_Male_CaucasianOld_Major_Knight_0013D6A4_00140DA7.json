    "Major Knight is the New California Republic Army officer in charge of the Mojave Outpost administration, working at the headquarters building in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "As the main administrator of the outpost, Knight is in charge of processing travelers passing through the Mojave Outpost, marking the border between the Mojave and the NCR. In practice, this means logging the traffic,",
    "He does not consider border guard duty an excellent posting, but is well aware that the alternative is being sent further east or patrolling the Colorado, both dangerous jobs putting soldiers in contact with the Legion.",
    "Knight is also frustrated by the fact that he feels forced to conceal his homosexuality while stationed at the Mojave Outpost. He feels that being open about his sexuality and forming relationships would complicate his position and make work difficult for him, due to the frontier seeming less forgiving of LGBT people. He wishes it was different, but accepts it, as the alternatives are worse (though he seems to think the Legion is more accepting of same-sex relationships, unaware they are punished by death). However, it does not mean he will not help fellow LGBT people: If they reveal themselves to him, he is perfectly willing to bend the rules and sign work orders to have their gear repaired at a fraction of the cost.",
    "Area designer J.R. Vosovic wrote for Major Knight, in addition to working on the rest of the Mojave Outpost. He cited Major Knight and Ranger Ghost as two of his favorite characters in the game."
