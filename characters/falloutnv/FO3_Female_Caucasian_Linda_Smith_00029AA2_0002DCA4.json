    "Linda Smith is an inhabitant of Andale in 2277.",
    "House-proud and vehemently opposed to outside influences, the Smiths are a strange but reasonably friendly bunch. Jack seems to be Andale's patriarch and he knows the best little town in America is here, where Linda bakes a delicious meat pie!",
    "Linda is part of a family of inbred cannibals that lives in Andale. She is married to Jack Smith and together they have a son, Junior Smith. Linda is the child of Old Man Harris.",
    "She, as a housewife, performs household chores and cooks meals while her husband goes to work with her neighbor and brother Bill in the \"family business,\" capturing and killing wastelanders in order to dine on their flesh. All of this cannibalistic activity is conducted in the Smiths' garden shed and the Wilson family basement.",
    "Linda Smith is the wife of Jack Smith and the mother of Junior Smith. Her father is Old Man Harris, and her mother was Gladys Smith.",
    "Rockville, which Linda says was beat out by Andale for town of the year, is the location of Bethesda's main offices."
