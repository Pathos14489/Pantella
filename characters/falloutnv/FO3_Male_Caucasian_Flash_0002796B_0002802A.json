    "Flash is a resident of Big Town in Fallout 3.",
    "Growing up together in Little Lamplight, Flash, Pappy, Bittercup, Red and Kimba were close, and often played together. They also traveled as a group to Big Town.",
    "On the surface, Flash exudes bravado and overconfidence, and has a penchant for making big, childish claims that he cannot really back up. For example, he is exceptionally proud of his \"kick-ass\" gun (in reality, a simple, weak .32 pistol) and boasts his desire to defend the town and kill super mutants with it.",
    "Flash previously dated Bittercup, but their relationship did not last long.",
    "Flash handles the patrolling of the town during daylight hours. At nighttime, he switches out with Bittercup and rests.",
    "PC Occurrences of Flash being met just outside of Meresti trainyard have happened when the player fast travels there prior to going to Big Town (obviously before Big Trouble in Big Town). If spoken to, his dialogue consists of his usual complaints about Big Town and super mutants. Flash will proceed to walk back to Big Town via the road just outside the trainyard. If not escorted by the player, there is a high chance of him being killed by super mutants or raiders during his journey."
