    "Ghost of She is a unique yao guai living in Zion Canyon in 2281.",
    "According to Waking Cloud, a Sorrows child once wandered into a yao guai's cave before her naming ceremony and was eaten by the beast. The Sorrows believe that the little girl and the yao guai became one, hence the name \"Ghost of She.\"",
    "This yao guai is an over-sized variant with a flaming body. It has a phenomenal attack power which can kill a heavily armored person in just a few blows, and after taking enough damage, it can create several doppelgangers of itself. Some of her strange physical characteristics may be a result of the Courier being under the influence of a datura derived drug.",
