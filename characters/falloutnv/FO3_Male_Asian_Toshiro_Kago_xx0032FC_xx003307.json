    "Toshiro Kago is a samurai from feudal-era Japan, abducted by the alien crew of Mothership Zeta and a temporary companion of the Lone Wanderer in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta.",
    "Toshiro was abducted from Japan by the Zetans sometime during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, between the late 1560s to early 1600s, and was then cryogenically frozen by them aboard Mothership Zeta. He remained preserved until centuries later, when the Lone Wanderer and Somah thaw him out. He joins them in their counterattack against the Zetans, seeking to reclaim his lost weapon in the process.",
    "Among the StarsThis Galaxy Ain't Big Enough...",
    "After the events of Mothership Zeta, he stays aboard Zeta and cannot be interacted with. He will disappear if one revisits the steamworks but will remain on the bridge if the player character travels to or from the Capital Wasteland. He can be found later in the living quarters.",
    "Despite being unable to understand English, Toshiro still responds with different dialogue depending on whether the player character speaks to him with polite, neutral, or smarmy dialogue options.",
    "Toshiro Kago appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta.",
    "Xbox 360 After completing the main quest of Mothership Zeta, with Toshiro still alive, it is possible to pickpocket him. In his inventory, his samurai sword will appear but trying to steal it may result in the game crashing."
