    "Cursor Lucullus is a ferryman for Caesar's Legion in Cottonwood Cove in 2281.",
    "Little is known of Lucullus. He is a cursor (courier) who transports Caesar's Legion members and allies from Cottonwood Cove to the Fort. When compared to other legionaries, he is noticeably taller.",
    "* After releasing the radioactive barrels into Cottonwood Cove.",
    "Area designer Robert Lee wrote and scripted for Lucullus.",
    "PC On newer hardware, when traveling to the Fort after talking to Lucullus, the loading screen will be glitched and will never end, even though the player has already loaded into the area. Using coc thefort can circumvent this bug, but will break some of the game's scripts and is not recommended as a fix. Running the 4GB Patcher mod will permanently fix this bug.",
