    "The Sink Auto-Doc is an artificial personality residing in the Sink in Big MT in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "A prototype model of an Auto-Doc with a personality module installed, it was built by Dr. Mobius before he left the Think Tank and all of The Sink's systems were disabled by Dr. Klein followed by their modules getting thrown off the balcony. The Doc's module ended up in the Y-17 medical facility. It also had the ability to do cosmetic procedures, install implants,",
    "After being transported to Big MT, the Auto-Doc performed surgery on the Courier and extracted their brain, a procedure that would normally result in its subject becoming a feral, mindless lobotomite due to an error in its programming. However, due to the unique scarring on the brain caused by a non-fatal gunshot to the head, the Auto-Doc was forced to adjust the operation routine and was successfully able to perform the intended operation and replace it with a functioning array of Tesla coils to mimic the brain's connection to the nervous system. Subsequently, however, the extracted brain was stolen by Mobius and brought to the Forbidden Zone to keep it away from the Think Tank.",
    "Even without the physical brain, the data from the Auto-Doc's successful procedure remained within the Think Tank's reach, potentially able to put them one step closer to figuring out how to do a reversal of the extraction and put their own brains into waiting host bodies, allowing them to escape Big MT and terrorize the Mojave Wasteland should they figure out how to access it.",
    "The Sink Auto-Doc appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues."
