    "Lucas Simms is a resident of Megaton, serving as the sheriff and de facto mayor, in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3.",
    "A native of Megaton, Lucas Simms grew up in the town and gained a deep understanding of what it takes to survive in the wasteland. Despite the harsh standard of living in the Capital Wastes, Lucas never surrendered his childhood cowboy fantasy, eventually acting on it to appoint himself the sheriff of Megaton in his adulthood; by 2277, few if any of the residents dispute his self-made position.",
    "Along with his capacity as sheriff, Lucas also takes care of any public duty necessary for the people of his town - mayor, judge, etc. - and deals with most troublemakers by unceremoniously throwing them out of the town.",
    "Despite his public position, most of the day-to-day affairs of Megaton are actually managed by Colin Moriarty, Simms' rival for control over the town.",
    "Among the inhabiting residents, Lucas is generally well-liked. While big and intimidating at first, he often wins people over with his friendliness, charm, and the rustic Wild West aesthetic he lives out (even naming his son after a pre-War outlaw of the Old West).",
    "Largely unknown to the public, at some point in his life, Simms also achieved membership in the secretive Regulators, serving the group's mission of combating evil and anarchy in the wasteland.",
    "According to the Fallout 3 Official Game Guide Pre-War Collectors Edition's Afterword, written by Moira Brown, Harden Simms took over his father's position of sheriff of Megaton sometime before or around 2297. She also notes that Harden often claims while drunk that the Lone Wanderer was responsible for his father's death, indicating that Lucas died sometime around or after 2277.",
    "If Lucas, Moriarty, or both are killed, Manya Vargas, Leo Stahl, and Harden will have unique dialogue when next talked to.",
    "Lucas Simms appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter, Fallout Shelter Online and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare."
