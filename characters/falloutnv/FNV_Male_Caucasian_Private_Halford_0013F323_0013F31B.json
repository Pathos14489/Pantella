    "Private Halford is a New California Republic Army military policeman stationed at Camp Guardian in 2281. The sole survivor of a lakelurk attack, he can be found injured in the Camp Guardian caves.",
    "Under the command of Sergeant Banner, Private Halford and eleven others were stationed at Camp Guardian. After clearing the long-neglected hiking trails to establish an NCR outpost, the camp began to suffer from supply problems. A week after their official request for a radio from Camp McCarran, they still had received nothing. Seeking to acquire a way to contact their superiors, they sent a runner to Ranger Station Bravo (an hour-long journey at full sprint) to request any kind of radio equipment they could spare, even if it was a handheld.",
    "The Rangers at Bravo gave the soldiers a handheld radio so they could use their equipment as a relay to Camp McCarran. Private Halford was put in charge of the handheld, as well as making their daily reports to Camp McCarran. The handheld worked well enough, though the camp's problems only got worse.",
    "Lakelurks attacked Camp Guardian one night, while some were sleeping in their tents. In the ensuing struggle, the camp was torn apart, and its logs scattered.",
    "He claims that, at the time of the attack, he was cleaning his firearm, and was knocked down and dragged down into the caves. He managed to grab his knife and throw it into the lakelurk's back. Once the mutant was on the ground with him, he beat and choked the creature to death.",
    "Eventually, he lost hope of ever seeing another human face;",
