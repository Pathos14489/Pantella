    "Grouse is a slaver at Paradise Falls in 2277.",
    "Grouse was born in 2247 and has been with the slavers since he was a teenager. His father was the former leader of the slavers before Eulogy Jones usurped him and rose to power. Because of this, Grouse believes that he has a legacy to live up to.",
