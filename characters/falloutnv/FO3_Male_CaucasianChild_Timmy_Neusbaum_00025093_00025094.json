    "Timmy Neusbaum is one of the residents of Vault 112, trapped within the Tranquility Lane simulation in Fallout 3.",
    "Timmy is the son of George and Pat Neusbaum, well-behaved and quiet, though somewhat of a \"momma's boy\" according to Bill Foster.",
    "He has set up a lemonade stand in Tranquility Lane per his mother's advice of \"if life gives you lemons, make lemonade,\" in an effort to save up money to purchase a Red Racer tricycle like the one Betty owns.",
    "In reality, Timmy is not a boy but an adult man, which Old Lady Dithers points out as having had an impact on his mental state and tries to talk him down, before he does something drastic.",
    "In the vault, the adult Timothy is identified as resident 377, and his torment manifests as an elevated heart rate of 112 beats per minute, high blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg, marginally elevated temperature of 37.167°C/98.9°F, and a breathing rate of 22 breaths per minute. Stress levels are nominal, suggesting this is his permanent status under Braun's \"care.\""
