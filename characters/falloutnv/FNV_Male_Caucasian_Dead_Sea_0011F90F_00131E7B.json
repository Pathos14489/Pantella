    "Dead Sea is a decanus of Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland who led the assault on the NCR outpost at the town of Nelson, taking it as a base for the Legion and starting a brutal ground war against the Army forces at the nearby Camp Forlorn Hope in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The warrior known as Dead Sea has never known a life outside the Legion. Taken from his former tribe near the Great Salt Lake as a child, he was raised and inculcated with Caesar's doctrine, creating an obedient and loyal soldier. Dead Sea's boundless devotion to his master led to a martial career, attaining the rank of decanus in 2276.",
    "Although zealously devoted to Caesar, Dead Sea personally craves glory in battle, to the point that he is able to recognize the triumph of another warrior and will offer his own weapon as reward, if only so he can harness his humiliation at being surpassed as motivation to pursue another accolade and a blade forged in its honor.",
    "Around 2281, Dead Sea and his fellow decanus Alexus were given orders by frumentarii leader Vulpes Inculta,",
    "While he does not second-guess or dispute Caesar's orders to remain in Nelson and harass the nearby NCR forces at Camp Forlorn Hope, Dead Sea's battlelust has left him frustrated with being stationed on what is basically a routine terror operation. Only the blood shed by repelling NCR retaliatory attempts and the demoralizing efforts of executing and/or crucifying their captives has calmed his thirst for blood, guts, and glory.",
    "Whether intentionally or not, the character's name is similar to that of the Dead Sea, a landlocked salt lake on the borders of Jordan, Israel, and the West Bank, so-named due to its significantly high salinity which surpasses that of oceanwater and which has led to its world renown as a natural health resort.",
    "Frumentarii: Alerio · Cato Hostilius · Gabban · Karl · Picus · Disguised frumentarius · Ulysses (formerly)\nConsul: M. Licinius Crassus · M. Scribonius Libo Drusus (of the consul)"
