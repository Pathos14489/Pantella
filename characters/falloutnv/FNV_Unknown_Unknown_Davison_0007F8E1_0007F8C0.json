    "Davison is the leader of Davison's nightkin who are looking for Stealth Boys in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Davison was once a captain in the Unity's service, leading the Master's elite, the nightkin, into combat. He recalls that he once held the rank of captain and that his last name is Davison, but he does not remember his first name.",
    "Ever since the fall of the Master in 2162, his mental state has been steadily deteriorating, both as a result of his wandering through the desert and use of Stealth Boys. The factors coalesced into particularly severe mental disorders characterized by delusions and schizophrenia. Following a brief stay with Marcus at Jacobstown, who tried to take care of the nightkin as best they could, Davison took his nightkin out into the wastelands again, following the guidance of \"Antler.\"",
    "The nightkin later seized the REPCONN test site, descending on the Bright Brotherhood occupying it and taking them by surprise, using the few Stealth Boys they still had available.",
    "Like many nightkin that had the misfortune of losing most of their intelligence, Davison is aggressive, impatient, and suspicious of others.",
    "He and all nightkin within the basement can be killed with no repercussions only after telling him the Stealth Boy shipment is no longer in the facility.",
    "Davison was written by John Gonzalez."
