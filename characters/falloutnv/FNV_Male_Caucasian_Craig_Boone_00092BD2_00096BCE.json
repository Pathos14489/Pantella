    "Craig Boone is a former member of the New California Republic's First Recon sharpshooter regiment, now retired and residing in Novac, where he serves as the night watchman, in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas. He is a possible companion of the Courier.",
    "Born around 2255,",
    "The NCR's first big skirmish with the Legion affected him little. What marked a turning point in Boone's life and worldly outlook came a year later, in 2278. He was sent with his First Recon squad to join an army expedition to retaliate against the Great Khans, the third incarnation of a longtime enemy of the NCR. Following several attacks on NCR settlements, the army tracked down the Khans to Bitter Springs, a suspected stronghold of theirs. What they did not know until it was too late is that it was also the Khans' main settlement, occupied not only by their warriors but a civilian population including children and the elderly as well. Boone's fireteam was deployed on Coyote Tail Ridge, overlooking a rear exit from Bitter Springs.",
    "The event, becoming known as the Bitter Springs Massacre, would break Boone. It turned him into a murderer, if not in the eyes of the NCR, then in his own. He left the army when his tour of duty ended, sick of war and suffering, seeking some way to try and start again, though he didn't really believe it. While on leave at the New Vegas Strip, he met a woman named Carla. She was talkative, charming, proud and everything Boone wasn't, but most importantly, she had helped him forget. When Boone was with Carla, everything about Bitter Springs left his mind. For a time, he was happy.",
    "He and Carla got married sometime in 2280,",
    "Then, life handed Boone another dose of cruel reality. One night, Legion slavers snuck into Novac while he was on watch, and took Carla, who was already pregnant with their unborn child at the time, but no one else. When he looked into it, Boone realized that they knew exactly when and how to sneak past him undetected and had a specific target in mind, and he knew right then that he was set up and someone who knew him and his habits helped them.",
    "Left on his own, the distraught marksman took to the road to track Carla down and save her. He eventually found her at a Legion outpost in the southeast Mojave, near the Colorado River. She was being sold off, with many men bidding on her. The entire area was locked down, guarded by legionaries in the hundreds. Bereft of any other options, Boone could only see one solution. He knew he would never find her if she crossed into Legion lands and that he could never abandon the woman he loved to the Legion. In that moment, Boone came to a soul-crushing decision as he took aim with his rifle and killed Carla with a single headshot. Forced to flee immediately, chased by Legion attackers, Boone never knew what they did with Carla's body or the baby she carried; perhaps he never wanted to know.",
    "He returned to Novac and resumed his duties as the town's watchman, but Boone was yet again a changed man, and not for the better. Apathy consumed every part of him, save for one emotion: hate. Boundless hatred for the Legions of Caesar, combined with a burning desire to exact revenge on the person who helped orchestrate the abduction and ultimately the death of his wife. Despite knowing that he would need the help of someone else to succeed, Boone always believed that he could never let anyone get close to him as Carla was again, lest the suffering owed to him for Bitter Springs comes to them too.",
    "Boone is overly stoic, serious, and slow to trust. This has been a fundamental part of his personality for a long time, but it severely hardened after the Bitter Springs Massacre, and even more so when he was forced to shoot his wife with his unborn child. As such, he is slow to show any emotion or reveal any sense of levity. Even when acting out of emotion, he keeps a very calm and controlled manner about him, befitting an ace-sniper.",
    "The Bitter Springs Massacre disillusioned him and caused his belief in his home country of the NCR to falter after distinguished service to First Recon. He has developed a deep skepticism against the NCR and its motives and outcomes, but this is balanced by a lingering deep respect for his fellow servicemen who remain in the line of duty. While he may not actively support the NCR's goals in coming to the Mojave, he will not, under any circumstances, support actively endangering them.",
    "Parallel to this is an unending and deep-seated hatred for Caesar and everything concerning his Legion. While he has always opposed the army from the east based on national conflict and ideological opposition, having his wife sold into slavery at their hands and being forced to take her life and that of their unborn child as the only way to \"save\" her from this fate cemented his eternal loathing against them. Therefore, he supports any action that will damage and/or cripple the Legion's ambitions and will completely refuse to support any action that would aid them under any circumstances, even if it means abandoning those he considers allies. Fighting the Legion is one of the few goals he continues to hold onto that keeps him going. His hated enemy's fondness for kidnapping and enslaving has also ingrained a general hatred of slavery of all stripes.",
