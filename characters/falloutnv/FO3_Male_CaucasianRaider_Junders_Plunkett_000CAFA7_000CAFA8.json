    "Junders Plunkett is a hostile outlaw inhabiting the Arlington House in 2277.",
    "Plunkett committed theft and murder in the town of Canterbury Commons, prompting the Regulators under Sonora Cruz to place a one-thousand cap bounty on his head. As the bounty has prompted the Regulators to harass his fellow raiders for information on his whereabouts, he has sought solace in a house in the Arlington Cemetery and has taken to building a shrine to an ancient figure named Lincoln.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer manages to dispatch Junders and collect the bounty on his head, Sonora Cruz will remark that \"it’s about time someone put that bastard out of his misery.\"",
    "Junders only appears in the game if the player character has the Lawbringer perk, and he will attack on sight. If killed, Junders Plunkett will have a unique finger on him which can be turned in for the bounty to Sonora Cruz, with 1000 caps paid as a reward. One does not need to kill Plunkett personally to get credit. Plunkett can die from any means, and the finger will be on his corpse.",
