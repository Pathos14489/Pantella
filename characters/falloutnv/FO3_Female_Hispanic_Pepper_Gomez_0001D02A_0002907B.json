    "Pepper Gomez is a Vault 101 resident in the year 2277.",
    "She is the wife of Officer Herman Gomez and the mother of Freddie Gomez.",
    "Pepper has raised Freddie in the vault by herself nearly his entire life. She is a good mother and cares for Freddie, but feels helpless when confronted with his behavior. It's obvious to everyone that Butch and the Tunnel Snakes have far more influence over Freddie, and Pepper is at the end of her rope.",
    "Trouble on the Homefront: She is encountered in the living quarters during the Lone Wanderer's visit.",
    "Should the Lone Wanderer choose to destroy the vault in Trouble on the Homefront, she may be discovered dead outside.",
    "Unlike her husband, she has a hostile attitude towards the Lone Wanderer."
