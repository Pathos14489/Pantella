    "Branchtender Maple is a member of the Treeminders and one of Oasis' armed defenders in Fallout 3.",
    "The newest member of the Treeminders, Maple does not divulge many details about her past, but does note that she was drawn to Oasis by the calls of the Great One, and that in order to become a Treeminder, she had to accept the teachings of Tree Father Birch and cast aside her dependence on technology.",
    "Maple is fervently loyal to both Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel to the point of being completely willingly subservient to them.",
    "Upon their arrival in Oasis, Maple is the first Treeminder that the Lone Wanderer meets alongside Birch. Provided that they do not offend Birch or the Treeminders, Maple is open and welcoming towards them.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer decides to resolve Oasis' dilemma by siding with Birch, Maple will gift them a unique garb, but warns them not to disclose to anyone where it came from, as it could put the Oasis at risk.",
    "Maple is the common name for genus Acer, a type of tree. All of the human residents in Oasis have horticultural names."
