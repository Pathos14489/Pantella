    "Trudy is a resident of Goodsprings in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281, where she is both the owner and bartender of the Prospector Saloon and the town's unofficial mayor due to her tough, wizened demeanor. She appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Around 2274, Trudy took over the ownership of the Prospector Saloon in Goodsprings and has been running it ever since.",
    "The day after the Courier was ambushed by them near the town cemetery, on October 12, 2281, However, Ringo was indeed pursued, and a group of Gangers led by Joe Cobb soon came to town demanding they hand over Ringo and threatening to destroy everything if they refused.",
    "So far, Trudy has stood her ground against Cobb's demands,",
    "Trudy can be asked questions about Goodsprings and the Powder Gangers, as well as the New California Republic, Caesar's Legion, and their upcoming second battle over Hoover Dam. She comments that the NCR is helping keep the region safe but is \"trying to do too much\" and \"spread too thin,\" while she disgustedly and fearfully describes the Legion as \"slavers, killers, and all other kinds of trouble\" who are rumored to be just barely away from overrunning the Mojave."
