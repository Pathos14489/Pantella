    "Private O'Hanrahan is an NCR soldier and part of the Misfits living in Camp Golf in 2281.",
    "O'Hanrahan's family got by with farming 40 acres of farmland (primarily maize and brahmin). Despite some lean years, the family had a good life, until a string of bad harvests forced the family to make some hard decisions. His father realized he can't feed a family of five without someone starving, so as the oldest child, he was sent to join the Army. After leaving his mother, father, and two sisters, he went through basic training and was shipped out to New Vegas to be part of the Mojave Campaign.",
    "Despite his great strength and physically imposing stature, O'Hanrahan is essentially a gentle giant. He likes being assigned to the picturesque Camp Golf and gets along fine with the rest of the squad, despite his dislike for violence and hurting people. He attributes this to the influence of his mother, who always reminded him that he needs to mind himself due to his strength and size.",
    "As far as problems with the Misfits are concerned, he believes that they are tied not so much to the absence of rigorous training, but the fact that they don't talk to each other and are mostly just cross with each other. He believes that a little more basic human niceness would go a long way towards getting the squad in shape.",
    "He's wary of advancing his proposition to the squad, as he fears they wouldn't take him seriously, on account of his straightforward personality.",
    "O'Hanrahan was written by area designer Travis Stout, who also wrote the rest of the Misfits."
