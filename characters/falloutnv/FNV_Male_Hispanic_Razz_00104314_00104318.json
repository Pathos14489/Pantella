    "Private Razz is an NCR soldier and part of the Misfits living in Camp Golf in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281.",
    "Razz was born in slums of the Boneyard and got out the first chance he got, leaving his family behind. He joined the Fiends in the Mojave for a time, but joined the New California Republic Army later since Fiends tend to not last long when the NCR are around; in his words, he joined because \"at least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns\" would be on his side.",
    "He was once addicted to Psycho, but has since kicked the habit.",
    "He has a rotten attitude for pretty much everything, like how the NCR Rangers get to stay in the resort, while the grunts have to live in tents.",
    "Razz was written by area designer Travis Stout, who also wrote the rest of the Misfits."
