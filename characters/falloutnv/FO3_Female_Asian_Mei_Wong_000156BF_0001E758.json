    "Mei Wong is a former slave staying in Rivet City in 2277.",
    "Mei is a reserved woman who does not like to talk. She was previously a slave, once held at Paradise Falls, and was owned by Allistair Tenpenny, but she managed to escape and went into hiding. Her past is known by Harkness and he has promised that she is safe in town. She is knowledgeable about the slavers and suspects that Sister could be a slaver but she is unable to prove her hunch and she is scared of him. Luckily, he does not recognize her.",
    "She lives in the common room of Rivet City and can usually be found there or in the Rivet City market. Mei can sometimes be found outside, wandering the flight deck, near James Hargrave and C.J. Young's baseball field.",
    "* The gun will appear only if you choose to provide her with 25 caps to buy a weapon from Flak 'N Shrapnel's."
