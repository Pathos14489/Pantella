    "Christie Young is the sole cleaning staffer aboard Rivet City in Fallout 3.",
    "Christie and her family (husband Henry and daughter C.J.) live what could be considered \"normal,\" middle-class lives in Rivet City. While her husband works as a handyman and mechanic for devices around the ship, she cleans the halls and keeps the ship's public areas tidy -- both thankless but necessary jobs.",
    "Like her husband Henry, Christie looks down on residents of the hangar deck, viewing them as ungrateful and unqualified and even saying they should \"know their place.\"",
    "Christie loves and is proud of her family.",
    "Christie and Henry's character flaw is that of pompousness,",
    "The Youngs also look down on Tammy Hargrave, calling her \"dreadful\" and a \"very troubled woman\" for her rudeness and alcoholic lifestyle. Tammy is emotionally abusive towards her son, James,",
    "In the morning and early evening she can be found in the Rivet City market, usually to get something to eat at Gary's Galley. In the late mornings and afternoon, she can be found on the upper deck, sweeping the floors. At night she sleeps in her family's quarters on the upper deck."
