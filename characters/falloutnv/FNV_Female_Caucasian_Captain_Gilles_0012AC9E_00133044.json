    "Captain Gilles is an NCR captain located in the Bitter Springs refugee camp in 2281.",
    "Captain Gilles is stationed at Bitter Springs in the north east region of the Mojave Wasteland. She is tasked with keeping the camp operational, but with the NCR's resources in other areas, she finds it difficult to do so. If left unchecked, the camp could soon become a dying spot for refugees.",
    "The eternal lack of resources, lack of hands to help, and the generally poor situation of  refugees are a disaster in the making. Worst of all, for the past six months someone has been shooting at the camp, killing soldiers and refugees and devastating an already shocked population. By the time the Courier arrives, eight refugees and three soldiers were killed, always with a single bullet to the head from extreme range.",
    "Climb Ev'ry MountainNo, Not Much",
    "I Forgot to Remember to Forget",
    "The ending slide in question",
    "Captain Gilles appears in Craig Boone's ending slides, illustrating Boone's bad ending, where he travels into New California and kills the officer responsible for the Bitter Springs Massacre. However, as Dhatri unambiguously identifies the officer as male, this is likely a case of reusing existing assets for illustration, rather than identifying Gilles as the reponsible party."
