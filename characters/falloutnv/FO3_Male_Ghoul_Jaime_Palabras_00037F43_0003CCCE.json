    "Jaime Dexter Palabras is a crazed ghoul in the Dunwich Building in 2277. He can be found worshiping a strange obelisk in the virulent underchambers.",
    "Jaime is of Hispanic ancestry,",
    "At some point during or after the 2250s,",
    "In his late twenties,",
    "Following his father's trail, he headed to the Dunwich Building, where he found him to have turned into a feral ghoul, only recognizing him because of the Krivbeknih laying on the ground near him. Jaime took up the book as a memento of his father, while resting his body against the warm stone of the unusual obelisk behind him."
