    "Colonel Royez is a member of the NCR Army stationed on the Long 15 in 2281.",
    "Colonel Royez is in charge of the NCR camp on the Long 15, managing supplies between California and the Mojave Outpost.",
    "At some point, Royez came to possess the unique Scorched Sierra power armor, decorated with a taxidermized bear head and various ornamental pieces, and unlike most suits of NCR salvaged power armor, retained the joint servos to function like standard power armor.",
    "If the Courier chooses to launch the nuclear weapons at NCR territory from Ulysses' Temple, he and his unit are transformed by the radiation into marked men and can be fought and killed after going through the Gate to Long 15.",
    "He and his squad of marked men soldiers are encountered in the irradiated Long 15, amidst the wreckage of three crashed vertibirds. Royez's very high health and high DT due to his armor are complemented by the high levels of radiation in the area, granting him a high level of health regeneration like all marked men.",
    "Royez appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Lonesome Road."
