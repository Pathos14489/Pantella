    "Leo Stahl is a citizen of Megaton in 2277.",
    "He has two siblings, a brother Andy and a sister Jenny. He is more extroverted and outspoken compared to his brother, and he enjoys talking to the customers of their restaurant. Together with his siblings, they run the local diner, the Brass Lantern.",
    "When he was a teenager, he spent time with caravaners and traveled to a few places around the wasteland. In his travels, he picked up a jet addiction, although he has been able to hide it from his siblings and the town, with the exception of Mister Burke, Colin Moriarty, and Doc Church. Colin wrote in his personal computer about Leo: \"Never trust a junkie. That's what I've learned trying to deal with this piece of work. He wanders in here higher than a bird in flight and tried to make it with Nova. She slapped him silly after he didn't want to pay, the good girl. I almost kicked him out myself, but he staggered out of here. That guy may just be the straw I need to break Andy's back.\"",
    "During the day he sells drinks in the Brass Lantern and wanders the town, while at night he satisfies his chem addiction at the water processing plant.",
    "Leo and his unmarked quest were written by quest designer Erik J. Caponi.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 Leo is one of the NPCs who are known to go missing. See Recovering missing NPC in Fallout 3 to learn how to resolve the issue. "
