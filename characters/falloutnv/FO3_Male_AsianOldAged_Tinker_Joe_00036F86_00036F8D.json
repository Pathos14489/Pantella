    "Tinker Joe is a merchant patrolling near the RobCo facility in Fallout 3.",
    "Tinker Joe is a traveling merchant who wanders the wastes with robotic companions, including an old Mister Gutsy army unit named Sergeant RL-3. He sells miscellaneous items, ranging from junk to equipment and weaponry.",
    "He is keen to sell Sergeant RL-3, to a point where he may sell him at a discount of 500 caps to the Lone Wanderer as he is tired of waking up to the Mister Gutsy playing \"revelry\" at him.",
    "Tinker Joe moves between the following locations:",
    "Joe sells Sergeant RL-3, a robot companion, for the price of 1,000 bottle caps (500 with a Barter skill of 70) if the player character has neutral Karma. If he is dead, Sergeant RL-3 will no longer be available for recruitment as a companion."
