    "Lieutenant Haggerty is a soldier of the NCR Army stationed at HELIOS One in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The commanding officer of the garrison at the HELIOS One power plant during the Mojave Campaign, Haggerty is not thrilled with the posting. Ever since the NCR wrested control of it from the Brotherhood of Steel, HELIOS has not been considered a priority target due to its minimal power output and the need for troops to shore up defenses along the Colorado. The lieutenant herself is keenly aware that their reduced numbers mean a determined attack by the Legion would wipe them out with ease,",
    "Her other frustration is being forced to rely on the \"services\" of an idiot with sunglasses, who wormed his way into being the local \"expert\" responsible for reactivating HELIOS."
