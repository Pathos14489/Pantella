    "Marjorie and Mortimer are the two conflicting leaders of the White Gloves and by default becomes the most influential member if, during the quest Beyond the Beef, Mortimer is ousted. She is not fond of being accused of cannibalism.",
    "If the Courier has at least \"accepted\" reputation with the Strip, she will give him/her a formal wear outfit and a membership as a White Glove Society member during the quest Beyond the Beef.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 Although Chauncey tells you to find Marjorie at the restaurant, she may not be able to be found outside of the members' section, making Beyond the Beef impossible to complete without an appropriate White Glove disguise. Very often, she stays stuck between chairs in the room. "
