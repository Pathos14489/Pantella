    "Amata Almodovar is a resident of Vault 101, the only child of Overseer Alphonse Almodovar, and a major character in Fallout 3. Along with Owyn Lyons and Sarah Lyons, she is one of only three characters in the game to have \"Very Good\" Karma.",
    "The only daughter of the overseer, Amata is around the Lone Wanderer's age and the two grew up together ever since James arrived in the Vault with his child in tow.",
    "Amata at the Lone Wanderer's birthday party",
    "The bond between Amata and the Lone Wanderer developed into a deep friendship over the years,",
    "Amata did not enjoy being the overseer's daughter, and she preferred to tackle challenges and resolve problems on her own so that she could appear more independent to the other residents. This included coming up with ways to manage Butch DeLoria, as she realized at a young age that relying on her father's position would only lead to ostracism and worse.",
    "This independent streak was reinforced by Alphonse's controlling behavior. He was puzzled and frustrated by Amata pushing him away as she grew older. While she embraced the virtues he taught her (loyalty, honesty, commitment, hard work), growing into a fine young woman in Alphonse's eyes, she saw him less as a father figure, and more as the aloof, distant overseer.",
    "Amata being harassed by unruly Tunnel Snakes",
    "Amata became the subject of bullying by the Tunnel Snakes, a \"gang\" that formed with her father's tacit approval under Butch DeLoria, though they shifted from insulting her familial ties to mocking her body image issues, calling her overweight, and making lewd suggestions. \nHer father was well aware of her situation and kept close tabs on her troubles with the Tunnel Snakes, with their harassment of Amata a major factor in deciding whether to tolerate their continued existence or not.",
    "Amata refused to leverage her father's position, leaving her with only the Lone Wanderer as a source of help and support.",
    "Her opportunity would come sooner than she'd have liked. When James decided to flee Vault 101 to restart Project Purity, the overseer went crazy, letting his security force off the leash.",
    "She was freed by the Lone Wanderer and witnessed them exiting Vault 101 into the wasteland. Amata had no doubts that she'd be able to defuse the situation, falling back on the tried-and-true strategy of smiling and pretending that everything was all right, even the murder of Jonas Palmer on orders from her father.",
    "With the door sealed again, she realized that isolation would mean the death of the Vault; eventually, it would reduce the population to a handful of inbred remnants.",
    "Predictably, attempts to crush the rebellion only inflamed it. Amata and Edwin Brotch became its leaders, rallying the youth and idealists around the idea of re-opening the Vault. The Tunnel Snakes, once Amata's bane, became the movement's muscle, taking over the Vault's clinic and schoolroom, but crucially missing storerooms, allowing the overseer to try and starve them out. Amata became the sole leader of the rebellion after Brotch was arrested for trying to open the Vault door on his own.",
    "While horrified at the idea of opening the Vault, Amata's father was proud of her natural talents for leadership, and viewed her as a worthy successor. In fact, it was her presence that prevented a violent crackdown, as he refused to make the mistake of giving the security force free reign in restoring order, unaware that the security officers were no longer fully under his control.",
    "Amata tries to get help from the Enclave.",
    "* Only if she was told to keep the pistol during \"Escape!\"",
    "Amata Almodovar appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter and Fallout Shelter Online."
