    "Christine Kendall is a resident of Vault 101 in 2277.",
    "Christine and her younger sibling Monica are the daughters of John and Mary Kendall. Playing up to her father usually results in a verbal ear-bashing or worse, so Christine has recently become more and more introverted. She's not happy in Vault 101 and wonders what life is like away from its concrete walls and fluorescent buzzing lights.",
    "At the G.O.A.T., Christine expresses her mother's desire for seeing her oldest daughter in either science or home economics.",
    "On August 3, 2274, before the achievement test, if the player character speaks with her, Christine will ask why they are speaking to her. After completing the test, Christine turns it in. Edwin Brotch, the teacher, informs this student that she will be working in the maintenance department with Stanley Armstrong and that he would be certainly pleased. She is infuriated and says that she will tell her father about the result, having an expectation that he will change her job assignment. Interacting with her after the G.O.A.T. sometimes makes her blurt that Mr. Brotch is a \"big fat liar.\""
