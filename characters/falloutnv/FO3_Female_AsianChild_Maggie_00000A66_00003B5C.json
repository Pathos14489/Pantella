    "Maggie is a Megaton resident in 2277.",
    "When Maggie was three years old, Billy Creel adopted her and brought her to Megaton. She has no memories of her life before Megaton. Billy was given a man's house ever since the man was shot in a raider attack; a few townspeople claim that Billy was the one behind that bullet that bought him his place in the town. Billy told Maggie the combination to his lost safe.",
    "Her real parents died during a raider attack in 2275. Maggie is a friendly girl running around the town. She appears to be interested in Harden Simms and discusses with Billy the prospect of her kissing the boy, to which Billy tells her to slow down, as she has plenty of time to do that later. She also asks Billy about \"the talk,\" stating that Harden has already had the talk.",
    "With the Child at Heart perk, one can convince Maggie to tell them the combination to Billy Creel's safe.",
    "The combination to the safe that Maggie gives to the Lone Wanderer is \"15, 16, 23, 42\" which is a reference to the numbers, a recurring sequence on the TV series Lost."
