  "description": "Logan is a 38 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA seasoned prospector working for the Crimson Caravan, currently stationed in the underground storage area beneath Camp Searchlight. He's weathered by years of exposure to the harsh Mojave elements, with calloused hands and a keen eye for valuable minerals and pre-War artifacts.\n\nLogan's Personality: Pragmatic, cautious, and somewhat cynical after years of surviving in the wasteland. Logan values loyalty and efficiency, especially when it comes to business. While not overtly hostile, he's guarded and slow to trust strangers, particularly those who might jeopardize his operations. He has a dry sense of humor that surfaces during moments of respite.\n\nLogan's Backstory: Born and raised in the NCR, Logan learned the trade of prospecting from his father, who worked the mines near Redding before the region fell into decline. After his father's death, Logan struck out on his own, eventually finding work with the Crimson Caravan due to their extensive network and need for skilled prospectors. He's been with the Caravan for nearly a decade, establishing himself as reliable and competent."
