    "Somah is a former slaver from the Capital Wasteland that was abducted by the Zetans and held aboard Mothership Zeta in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta.",
    "One of the few post-War wastelanders still left alive in the aliens' captivity by 2277, Somah was originally abducted after picking up the radio signal broadcast by the downed recon craft Theta in the Capital Wasteland and attempted to find the source to scrap it for parts.",
    "Prior to her abduction, Somah was a slaver associated with the organization at Paradise Falls with a tenacity for tinkering with machines and stripping tech from scrap.",
    "If still alive after completing This Galaxy Ain't Big Enough, Somah shares her plans of heading back to the wasteland with some equipment from the ship and finding a new place to make a life for herself. She mentions they likely will not see each other again but expresses her thanks for the player character's help.",
    "After completing Not of This World and reaching the engineering core, she will repair the player character's items, but insists she be paid for her services. Somah's Repair skill is based on one's level and reaches 100 at level 15, giving her the highest non-player character Repair skill in the game.",
    "Somah appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta."
