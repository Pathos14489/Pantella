    "Motor-Runner is the leader of the Fiends, located in Vault 3 in 2281.",
    "Described as being the sanest of the Fiends, Motor-Runner was mentally stable enough to control the band of drugged psychotics and organize them into a credible fighting force, even managing to establish a base of operations through a violent takeover of Vault 3. Ranger Bryce Anders remarks that Motor-Runner has survived several previous NCR assassination attempts, which prompted Colonel Hsu to give Anders the mission of killing the Fiend leader personally. According to Hsu, Motor-Runner has a habit of decapitating dead NCR troopers. Motor-Runner regularly purchases slaves, and did business with Dermot and Saint James on at least two occasions. The first time he purchased a teen girl for 500 caps, but gave nothing for the girl's father since the man attacked him. At another point he purchased a woman from the pair for 250 caps, but gave only 25 caps each for her elderly parents, and nothing for the woman's infant son. He is found in his throne room in the Vault 3 maintenance wing flanked by his two guard dogs, BoneGnash and GhashBone.",
    "The Courier can sell him various drugs (Jet, Psycho, Buffout) for 20 caps (or 22 caps, if the player passes the Barter check) if passing a Speech check at the entrance of Vault 3 when speaking to the Fiend at the door. 22 caps are more than the player character will ever be able to receive from selling drugs valued at 20, with the exception of one instance involving Ricky.",
    "Motor Runner is the Four of Spades in the deck of Vault playing cards included with the Collector's Edition of Fallout: New Vegas."
