    "Elder Owyn Lyons is the leader of the East Coast Brotherhood of Steel in 2277.",
    "Lyons was born in the early years of the 23rd century, and was originally a Brotherhood of Steel paladin stationed at the Lost Hills bunker in South California. In 2251, his daughter Sarah was born. Sarah's mother died some time afterwards.",
    "In 2254 the Brotherhood's ruling council decided to send a contingent of soldiers to the East Coast, with three important objectives. First, to scour the ruins of Washington, D.C., once the nation's capital, and recover any and all advanced technology. Second, to investigate the reports of super mutant activity in the area. Thus a small but hardened contingent of Brotherhood of Steel soldiers, led by Paladin Lyons (and accompanied by his three-year-old daughter Sarah, friend and technological adviser Scribe Rothchild, as well as Star Paladin Cross, Paladin Henry Casdin, Initiate Ishmael Ashur, Paladin Tristan, Knight Colvin and Paladin Gunny) set out from Lost Hills and began the long journey east to what was once Washington D.C.",
    "Contact with the Midwestern Brotherhood turned out to be unsuccessful. On their way during their journey to the Capital Wasteland, the Brotherhood's expeditionary force came across the ruins of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In a single night, the Brotherhood swept through the city from their staging area at Mount Wash, eliminating any resident who put up a fight. The intent of the Scourge remains unclear, but several unmutated children were taken from The Pitt by the Brotherhood and placed into initiate training, and many in the Brotherhood note that it was a marked change in the way the Brotherhood operates. Additionally, it is known that something was recovered from The Pitt during the Scourge, although to date it would seem that only Elder Lyons knows what it was.",
    "Lyons' group finally arrived in the Capital Wasteland in 2255, establishing a base of operations within the Pentagon in the first few months.",
    "Shortly after their arrival, Lyons' scouts have identified a new threat in the area: a peculiar breed of super mutants, infesting the deserted ruins of downtown D.C. Concerned by their presence and convinced that they are the primary threat to the wasteland, Lyons initiated a protracted campaign of aggression to exterminate them. Fighting the super mutants, simply keeping them at bay, may have been enough for the area's wastelanders, but for the Brotherhood, too many questions remained; foremost among them, the means by which these new mutants were being created, where they were being created and why they were using the people of the Capital Wasteland. Finding these answers would, ultimately, become Owyn Lyons' obsession.",
    "The newly appointed elder decided that the super mutants were a threat not just to the Brotherhood and their scouts in D.C., but all the people in the wasteland. Thus, he began to direct resources towards fighting the mutants, gradually reducing the importance of fulfilling the primary mission objective, that is, recovering technology.",
    "The years passed, but not in a way anyone had foreseen. Indeed, the Brotherhood of Steel's importance to the people of the Capital Wasteland was not something that Lyons ever expected. Nor was it something his superiors back in California cared at all about. Their newest elder had a clearly defined mission: to acquire advanced technologies in and around the ruins of Washington D.C. Finding the source of the super mutant threat and destroying it was important too, of course, but Lyons' prime objective was, first and foremost, the acquisition of technology. The super mutants were his second priority. Thus was the subject of every communication from the Brotherhood of Steel leadership in California.",
    "However, Elder Owyn Lyons had another priority, one he considered more important than his original directive or any orders received since, which was the protection of the innocent people of the Capital Wasteland. And so, Lyons sent word to his superiors that he would continue his search for technology when he was damned good and ready, and would not sacrifice the people who had come to rely on the bravery and strength of the Brotherhood of Steel.",
    "With the conflict straining his resources, Lyons attempted to persuade the West Coast, for several years, to send reinforcements and supplies, claiming to be following the mission objectives, but in secret, he continued to order his subordinates to save people by killing super mutants. However, no lie can be sustained indefinitely. Things came to a head when Lyons outright refused to follow a direct order from the elders. In response, the West Coast swiftly cut him loose, shutting off communications and denying any and all reinforcements. By 2277 there was no communication between the East Coast chapter and Brotherhood HQ for years.",
    "The Californian corridors of Lost Hills erupted in rumor and speculation. Some claimed Owyn Lyons had \"gone native,\" putting the needs of the people of D.C. above those of the Brotherhood itself; others saw him as a Brotherhood elder finally exhibiting the selfless behavior that should serve as a model for the entire order. Caught in the middle, the ruling elders made a decision: they would still recognize Elder Lyons as a leader of the Brotherhood of Steel and the Citadel as their D.C. headquarters, but all support from the West Coast was thereby cut off. If Lyons wanted to pursue his own agenda on the East Coast, he would have to do it alone.",
    "Most of Elder Lyons' soldiers supported his dedication to the people of the Capital Wasteland and were proud of their leader's commitment to honor and heroism. The conflict with the super mutants dragged on for years, straining resources and manpower to the breaking point. Without the Brotherhood's support, the situation became progressively worse. However, Lyons' men continued to stick with him and follow his orders, primarily out of the doctrine of loyalty the Brotherhood taught them from birth.",
    "Rallying behind Paladin Henry Casdin,",
    "This was, without question, Owyn Lyons' darkest hour. He had become a man of compassion and understanding, and couldn't help but sympathize with those who had left; he had abandoned the Brotherhood’s primary mission. He recognized that and took full responsibility for it. Some of the knights and paladins who left had been his brothers for years. Together, they had shared victory and loss, pain and elation. But to those soldiers loyal to Elder Lyons, this dereliction of duty and theft of technology was an act of cowardice and treason. The dissenters would call themselves the \"Outcasts,\" traitors to the Brotherhood of Steel; it was a name they would ultimately wear like a badge of honor, proud of the distance it put between themselves and Lyons' \"soldier sycophants.\" One of these people who left was none other than Henry Casdin, who became the founder of the Outcasts.",
    "The East Coast Brotherhood began 2277 as a diminished, weakened force, suffering from a shortage of qualified combat personnel and severely depleted stocks of weapons and equipment. As a result, the Brotherhood had a limited presence outside the Citadel, with only a handful of reinforced outposts scattered across the Washington metropolitan area, making Elder Lyons incredibly tired by his inability to act.",
    "A year passed since many of his soldiers left to form the Brotherhood Outcasts, but Lyons was still dedicated to the cause of helping the people of the Capital Wasteland. He continued to send his troops into the D.C. ruins to help any who needed it, including the protection of Three Dog, a disk jockey who tries to get the message of the \"good fight\" to the people of the wasteland.",
    "The Enclave attacked and occupied the Jefferson Memorial, where Project Purity called home. James, the leader of the project, sacrificed his life in an attempt to thwart Colonel Autumn's attempt to take over the project. While he failed to stop the Enclave, he managed to save the lives of the scientist Madison Li and his child, the Lone Wanderer. The two eventually made it to the Citadel, where Lyons allowed them safe haven.",
    "After hearing of the resurgence of the Enclave, he immediately declared war on the Enclave and began a campaign to stop them. The Lone Wanderer required a Garden of Eden Creation Kit to get Project Purity functional and Lyons pointed them in the direction of Reginald Rothchild, after speaking to Rothchild, the Lone Wanderer headed to Vault 87 for the G.E.C.K.",
    "Shortly before the Lone Wanderer's return, Owyn Lyons was debating with his daughter whether or not to launch an assault on the Jefferson Memorial and reclaim it from the Enclave. The Lone Wanderer returned to tell Lyons some ill news: that the Enclave had stolen the G.E.C.K. and would shortly activate the purifier. With this piece of information and his daughter's eagerness to attack, he ordered Lyons' Pride to assault the project and occupy it.",
    "After the battle was won, the Brotherhood occupied the Jefferson Memorial and began to distribute clean, fresh water to the people of the Capital Wasteland.",
    "Lyons once again enlisted the help of the Lone Wanderer to help defeat the Enclave, sending them to assist with the assault of the Satellite relay station and also tasked the Lone Wanderer with finding a Tesla coil in the ruins of Old Olney. After the Wanderer had completed these tasks they were sent to Adams Air Force Base to destroy the Enclave's last known major base of operations.",
    "Sometime prior to August 2279, Owyn Lyons passed away, leaving behind leadership to his daughter Sarah Lyons, which was short lived as she perished in battle shortly thereafter. The East Coast Brotherhood subsequently floundered, led by successive ineffectual leaders.",
    "Over the years, Maxson would proceed to carry out reforms which brought the chapter away from Lyons' beliefs and closer to Brotherhood orthodoxy, which in turn diminished Lyons' accomplishments in the eyes of the reunified chapter's members. By 2287, despite his accomplishments as the original leader of the East Coast Brotherhood, Owyn Lyons is remembered by soldiers of Maxson's Brotherhood as the \"foolish\" elder that led the Brotherhood astray from their true path of preserving technology.",
    "However, Lyons' beliefs are not entirely lost. At least one member of Lyons' Brotherhood, an unnamed scribe, disagreed with its return to \"ancient tradition\" under Arthur Maxson and chose to leave the Brotherhood rather than compromise his values.",
    "His daughter, Sarah Lyons, is a member of the Brotherhood with the unique rank of sentinel. Reginald Rothchild is an old friend of Elder Lyons.",
    "As the leader of the Brotherhood of Steel, Lyons spends most of his day in the Citadel laboratory, A-ring or B-ring. He regularly converses with Scribe Rothchild, Bowditch, and Peabody on their various projects. In addition, he checks up on the progress on the Brotherhood's major project, rebuilding Liberty Prime, and supervises the armory as well as the smithy. When he is not working in the Citadel lab, he is usually eating in the A-ring's great hall, studying in his room in B-ring or sleeping.",
