    "Samuel Kerr is a merchant operating at the 188 Trading Post with his daughter Michelle in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Around a month prior to October 2281,",
    "With the amount of soldiers passing through the 188, neither Samuel nor Michelle believe the Legion will threaten them anytime soon. Even if they do, they believe they can take care of themselves. In the worst case, they don't mind packing up shop and leaving for a new location again.",
    "If the escaped convicts around and inside the Bison Steve Hotel in Primm are wiped out during the quest(s) They Went That-a-Way and/or My Kind of Town, Samuel will have a unique dialogue option: the Courier can mention that they helped clear out the convicts, but Samuel will whimsically respond that he and Michelle have moved on and do not care about Primm's situation anymore."
