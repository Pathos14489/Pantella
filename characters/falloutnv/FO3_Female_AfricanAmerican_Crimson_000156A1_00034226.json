    "Crimson is one of Eulogy Jones's two slaves in Paradise Falls in the year 2277.",
    "Crimson is a prostitute, one of two caught and pressed into slavery by Eulogy Jones a few months before meeting the Lone Wanderer. She along with Clover are abused by their master, and attempt to stay out of his way. They will not talk to strangers. When Eulogy is not present, they will speak with one another, usually to bicker. At times, Crimson will speak back to Eulogy when he insults her.",
    "Crimson can be found following Eulogy Jones around in Paradise Falls. The best chance to meet her is in Eulogy's pad, located near the slave pens."
