  "description": "Jackson is a 36 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA gritty man who can often be found near restroom areas in GNR plaza, close to the Museum of Technology entrance. He wears scavenged raider armor and carries a worn 10mm pistol.\n\nJackson's Personality: Brutal and self-serving. Jackson operates on the principle of 'might makes right.' He shows no remorse for his actions, viewing others as either obstacles to be removed or opportunities to be exploited.\n\nJackson's Backstory: Born in the harsh wasteland shortly after the Great War, Jackson learned from a young age that only the strong survive. His parents were killed by raiders when he was just a boy, forcing him to fend for himself in the dangerous Capital Wasteland. As he grew older, he joined a raider group that specialized in ambushing travelers and selling them into slavery. When his group was decimated by a Brotherhood of Steel patrol, Jackson struck out on his own but continued his slaving operations on a smaller, more cautious scale."
