    "Lieutenant Thomas Morgan is an intelligence and logistics officer providing American soldiers with intel and clearing requisitions at the U.S. Army field headquarters in the Anchorage Reclamation simulation in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "Thomas Morgan is a young officer of the Intelligence Corps,",
    "As part of his duties, Morgan processes intel, combining reconnaissance reports, radar monitoring and other data,",
    "He also ensures that soldiers equip themselves with the correct gear for upcoming missions, using requisition terminals that ensure proper paperwork is filled (though he dislikes the amount of bureaucracy),",
    "He refers to the strike team as \"Patterson's suicide team.\"",
    "1 He carries a 10mm pistol skinned with the wasteland version graphics, instead of the pre-War version typical in the simulation. He cannot be induced to draw the weapon, nor can it be pickpocketed from him.",
    "Thomas Morgan appears only in a simulation in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage."
