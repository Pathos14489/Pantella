    "Dunbar is a ghoul found dead, near Carl, in the Old Olney underground in 2277.",
    "Dunbar was a perennial joker, and always chuckled about the problems these \"smoothskins\" were having coping with radioactive dust. He found it ironic that ghouls, who have evolved to ignore the radiation blighting the landscape, are holed up in a building well away from the Wasteland. Dunbar soon came to realize he wanted more from life than to sit and pine quietly for Tulip, so he joined a group of ghouls intent on establishing a settlement in a new and exciting locale. Perhaps too exciting since the place was infested with deathclaws.",
