    "Ryan Brigg is a wasteland scientist masquerading as a raider in the Jury Street Metro station in 2277.",
    "Ryan Brigg is a wasteland inventor conducting research on the widely-available mole rat meat in an attempt to improve its taste. As a result, he has come up with wonder meat that he plans to sell in order to fund further experimentation to refine his creation. To secure his innovation and investments, he poses as a raider captain in order to recruit the manpower he needs.",
    "According to the computer in his small hideout, he has been running experiments to eliminate the bitter taste of mole rat meat. After 173 attempts, he has finally created his restorative and tasty mixture of wonderglue and mole rat meat cured in a metal box together to formulate his amazing mole rat wonder meat. His expenditures have left him near-destitute, but he firmly believes that his product will be more than able to recoup his investment.",
    "Ryan has a locked-up and domesticated mole rat named Pumpkin that was the pet of Chucky, one of his former recruits, before his demise. Ryan personally shot Chucky, annoyed over Chucky's complaints about his pet mole rat being eaten, and attempting to impress his other subordinates in the process."
