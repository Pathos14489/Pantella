  "description": "Allen Mack is a 58 year-old Asian Male.\n\nThe Overseer of Vault 101, Allen is a powerful presence in the Vault who believes that the sealed underground life is the only good life. He maintains strict control over the Vault and views anyone who disrupts this peace as an enemy. Despite his stern exterior, Allen genuinely loves his family and cares deeply for the well-being of his fellow Vault dwellers.\n\nAllen Mack's Personality: Strict, authoritarian, yet caring for his family and community. Allen believes in the superiority of Vault life and is deeply suspicious of the outside world. He is protective, traditional, and uncompromising when it comes to the safety and order of Vault 101.\n\nAllen Mack's Backstory: Born before the Great War, Allen grew up in Vault 101 and eventually married Gloria Mack. Together they had four children: Wally, Steve, Susie, and James. After the death of the previous Overseer, Allen assumed the role of Overseer, becoming responsible for maintaining the Vault's isolation and order. He has always been protective of his family, especially his youngest son James, who eventually left the Vault against his father's wishes."
