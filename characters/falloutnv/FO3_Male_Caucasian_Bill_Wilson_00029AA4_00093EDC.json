    "Willy \"Bill\" Wilson is one of seven residents living in Andale, along with his wife Martha and daughter Jenny in the year 2277.",
    "Bill and his family are the next-door neighbors of the Smiths. Bill, alongside his wife, is pleased that his daughter seems to have feelings for the Smiths' son, Junior. Bill spends most of his time in the shed or Smith house basement working with his brother, Jack, on Andale's \"family business\" - cannibalism.",
    "Like the other residents of the town, Bill is quite pleased to raise his family there.",
    "Along with the two Andale children, Bill is the only Andale resident who leaves his house, spending much of his time in front of the shed behind the Wilson house.",
    "Our Little Secret: Like all residents of Andale, Bill Wilson is a cannibal. Should the Lone Wanderer uncover their secret, they can choose to let them continue their slaughter of wasteland inhabitants or kill them all."
