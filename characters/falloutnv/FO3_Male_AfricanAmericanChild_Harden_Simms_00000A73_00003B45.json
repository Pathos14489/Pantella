    "Harden Simms is an inhabitant of Megaton in 2277.",
    "Harden was born in 2267. He is Lucas Simms' 10-year-old son. His father has instructed him not to talk to strangers in Megaton, and he reluctantly obeys. He goes to sleep early and rises early, which gives him enough time to meet up with Maggie and play.",
    "By 2297, Harden is the sheriff of Megaton. When drunk, he often speaks about his father's death, and blames it on the Lone Wanderer.",
    "He is a good friend of Maggie and is usually seen near her in the mid-morning to late afternoon. It is implied by his father, Lucas Simms, that Harden also polishes Deputy Steel on a regular basis, but this is idle chatter as the child is not scripted to enter the Megaton armory.",
    "According to the Fallout 3 Official Game Guide, Harden's father named him after the real-life Old West outlaw John Wesley Hardin."
