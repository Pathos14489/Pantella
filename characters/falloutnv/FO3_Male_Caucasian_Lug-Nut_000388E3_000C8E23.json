He recently had two pairs of nightwear made by a man known as The Tailor, a post-War master of apparel. Lug-Nut sent one set of the nightwear to his brother Lag-Bolt.",
    "Lug-Nut is mentioned by Sierra Petrovita when asked more about Ronald Laren. She will start talking about how tough Ronald is and will mention Lug-Nut and two other raiders. The two unknown raiders were killed by Ronald, who then punched Lug-Nut in the face."
