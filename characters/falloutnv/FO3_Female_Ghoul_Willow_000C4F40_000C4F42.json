    "Willow is a ghoul who serves as the sentry of Underworld in the year 2277.",
    "Underworld's forward observer, Willow is young and satirical, calling visitors to the Mall \"tourists\" and inquiring if they have a death wish as they have entered a combat zone.",
    "She claims that she is not harassed by super mutants, who she calls \"knuckle draggers,\" chalking it up to them seeing ghouls as family.",
    "She provides basic information about Underworld, giving directions and pointing out that not many of its inhabitants are hospitable, but if one has caps and is not a \"ghoul hater,\" then the residents are willing to engage in trade.",
    "She can usually be found on the Mall, wandering around just outside the entrance to the Museum of History."
