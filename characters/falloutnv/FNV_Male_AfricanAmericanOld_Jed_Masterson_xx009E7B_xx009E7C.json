    "Jed Masterson is a traveling merchant who works for the Happy Trails Caravan Company in 2281.",
    "Masterson was a caravaneer who headed a Happy Trails caravan run into Zion Canyon, looking to delay Happy Trail's demise by trading with the Mormons in New Canaan, who had always been reliable for trade.",
    "He had never been to Zion before and needed someone with a Pip-Boy 3000 in order to map out the area and its natural hazards; The Courier was able to fill this role, but was unable to protect Masterson and the other caravaneers from their untimely deaths when the caravan was ambushed by White Legs when they arrived in Zion.",
    "Jed will react to the deaths of his traveling companions.",
    "Jed Masterson appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Honest Hearts.",
    "Jed Masterson was written by area designer Travis Stout.",
