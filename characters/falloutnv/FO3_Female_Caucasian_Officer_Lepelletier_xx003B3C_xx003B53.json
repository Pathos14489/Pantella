    "Officer Lepelletier is a member of the Rivet City security force in 2277.",
    "Serving as a member of the Rivet City security force, Lepelletier's dedication to duty earned her the right, or rather the misfortune, to be placed in charge of Rivet City's side of the Water Distribution Network following the Brotherhood's liberation of Project Purity. In exchange for money and technology, Rivet City and Lepelletier are cooperating with the Brotherhood to deliver water to the Capital Wasteland via armed caravans. Working out of a makeshift office just outside of Rivet City, Lepelletier deals with the caravan drivers, guards, and brahmin as they all work to deliver the water to the wasteland. However, almost as soon as the caravans started delivering water, they started getting ambushed. Lepelletier suspects something organized is going on.",
