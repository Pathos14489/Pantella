    "Protector McGraw is a high-ranking member of the Brotherhood Outcasts, and the commanding officer of the Outcast outpost at Bailey's Crossroads in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "One of the more personable Outcasts, McGraw can be direct, but polite in his dealing with wastelanders, rather than rude and condescending, which is a noted departure from the leadership style demonstrated by other Outcasts. McGraw leads an independent patrol focusing on recovering technology from a recently uncovered compound belonging to Virtual Strategic Solutions. Located in Bailey's Crossroads, the facility is located deep within super mutant country and the patrol could be wiped out at any minute. However, McGraw is willing to risk his life to uncover its secrets, and the lives of his men.",
    "Their mission has not been going well. The Outcasts have suffered significant casualties due to constant mutant attacks, to the point that a single concentrated assault could wipe them all out.",
    "In fact, his second in command, Defender Sibley, does not trust the protector and doubts both his motives and apparent lack of will.",
    "McGraw's decisions have grown erratic as a result of this pressure. In order to acquire some means of interfacing with the simulation pod at VSS, McGraw had Defender Morrill abduct Gary 23 from the derelict Vault 108. When the clone proved unable to understand the Outcasts and remove the Pip-Boy 3000 he was wearing, McGraw ordered Olin and the others to cut off his arm and remove it by force. Both the device and the clone were lost.",
    "All of these factors mean that McGraw is ready to make the ultimate sacrifice: Negotiate with a local to secure a mutually beneficial deal and trade precious tech for their services.",
    "Note: 30 MFC are guaranteed to spawn, with a 75% chance for 15 more. Laser rifle's condition is randomly leveled, and has 65% max.",
    "Protector McGraw appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "Outcast members Sibley, Olin, McGraw and Morrill, all of who appear in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage, appear to be named after buildings on the campus of Cornell University, including Sibley Hall, Olin Hall, Olin Library, McGraw Hall, McGraw Tower and Morrill Hall."
