    "Blind Diode Jefferson, also known as simply the Jukebox, is an artificial personality inhabiting the Sink in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Blind Diode Jefferson was created by Doctor Mobius in collaboration with Doctor 8's soundwave research and the creation of the sonic emitter and other frequencies it can be attuned to. He was taken offline in the past when Doctor Klein scattered the Sink appliances' personality chips from the Think Tank's balcony, later recovered by other Big MT staffers with the Jukebox's returned to 8's residence in Higgs Village.",
    "Once reactivated in the Sink, Blind Diode Jefferson is found to speak with a slow drawl, similar in style to a stereotypical Deep South Blues musician.",

    "Blind Diode Jefferson appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues."
