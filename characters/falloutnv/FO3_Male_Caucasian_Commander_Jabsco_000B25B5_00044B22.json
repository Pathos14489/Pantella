    "Commander Jabsco is the leader of the Talon Company in Fallout 3, and the only member of the organization not to wear its trademark armor. Instead, he wears metal armor and a Talon Company combat helmet, a unique piece of armor, and uses the Occam's Razor unique weapon in close combat, on top of being the boss character of the Fort Bannister dungeon.",
    "Jabsco is the brains of Talon Company, planning mercenary operations from the safety of his bunker within Fort Bannister. Although he claims to be a combat veteran who proved his ability many times over, his subordinates have yet to see proof of his claims. In fact, he is called Jetting Jabsco behind his back, as he apparently tends to flee combat rather than face anything other than favorable odds.",
    "Jabsco is jokingly referred to as \"Supreme Overlord\" in the editor ID for his in-game reference, which can be seen in his script."
