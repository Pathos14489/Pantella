    "Antony is a former member of the Hangdogs tribe from Colorado, by 2281 serving as a houndmaster for Caesar's Legion at the Fort in the Mojave Wasteland. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Antony was born into the Hangdogs, a tribe residing in and around the pre-War city of Denver, Colorado that became known for their symbiotic relationships and spiritual worship of the packs of wild dogs that inhabited the ruins. Antony himself was an ardent worshiper of the tribe's beliefs and their hounds.",
    "Sometime during the Legion's movement to regain their strength after the First Battle of Hoover Dam and their loss to the New California Republic in 2277, Legate Lanius led a campaign to conquer Denver which the Hangdogs resisted, and did so for the longest time compared to other tribes near there.",
    "While the Hangdogs have been wiped from history, in his new position Antony's mongrels are his life; he thinks very highly of their ability and considers them worthy of the utmost respect.",
    "In contrast to his hounds, Antony shares other Legion members' callous and contemptuous attitude towards their slaves, even including the child Melody; in her case, he considers it a privilege that she is even allowed to wear clothes. When he discovered she was keeping a teddy bear, he confiscated and gave it to his dogs as a chew toy purely out of cruelty.",
    "If the Courier orders Rex to stay outside the Fort's interior before approaching Antony inside, he will still give the unique dialogue as if Rex was present.",
