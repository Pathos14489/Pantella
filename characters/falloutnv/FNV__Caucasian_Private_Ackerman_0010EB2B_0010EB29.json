Monroe's squad and was captured during an ambush while on patrol.\n\nPrivate Ackerman's Personality: Disciplined and loyal to the NCR, but anxious and fearful of his current situation. He's trying to maintain his military bearing despite being a hostage.\n\nPrivate Ackerman's Backstory: Private Ackerman enlisted in the New California Republic army at a young age, seeking purpose and adventure. He was assigned to Lt. Monroe's squad and often patrolled the area between Novac and Boulder City. During one such patrol in October 2281, his squad was ambushed by a group of Great Khans. While the rest of the squad managed to escape, Ackerman and his fellow soldier, Private Gilbert, were taken hostage and brought to the Great Khan hideout in the ruins of Boulder City."
