    "Bessie Lynn is a ghoul residing in Warrington station in 2277.",
    "Bessie is a timid and nervous woman who consistently defers to her boyfriend Roy Phillips in all matters, stemming from her self-consciousness at having become a ghoul. Although she has accepted her new physical state, she mentions how she once was pretty and adored by many, and how her ghoulification has put an end to such things. If the Lone Wanderer has not yet completed the Tenpenny Tower quest, Bessie can be found in the living quarters of Warrington station.",
    "Bessie Lynn is in a relationship with Roy Phillips and lives together with him and Michael Masters deep inside of Warrington station.",
    "* Only if the Tenpenny Tower quest is completed by allowing the ghouls to live in the tower.",
    "Tenpenny Tower: If it is chosen to kill all of the ghouls, Bessie Lynn is one of the targets that needs to be eliminated.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer has completed the Tenpenny Tower quest by letting the ghouls in, she will take over the New Urban Apparel store, and can be found there from then on out."
