  "description": "Matilda West is a 50 year-old Caucasian Female.\n\nMatilda West was a long-time resident of the isolated village of Arefu, living there with her husband Davis for over ten years prior to her death in August 2277. She was a devoted mother to Ian and Lucy, though she struggled to understand her son's mysterious condition.\n\nMatilda West's Personality: Matilda was a caring and family-oriented woman who valued stability and tradition. She devoted herself to her husband and children, though she could be somewhat naive about serious issues within her family.\n\nMatilda West's Backstory: Matilda West moved to Arefu with her husband Davis over a decade before 2277, seeking a quieter life away from the dangers of the Capital Wasteland. Together they built a home and raised their children, Ian and Lucy. While Lucy eventually left to pursue opportunities in Megaton, Ian remained at home, though he struggled with a mysterious condition that neither he nor Lucy felt comfortable discussing with their parents. Matilda took pride in her role as a mother and wife, performing her duties in the village without complaint, including the unpleasant task of cleaning the outhouse. Her life came to a tragic end when her son, overcome by his condition, attacked and killed both her and her husband in their sleep."
