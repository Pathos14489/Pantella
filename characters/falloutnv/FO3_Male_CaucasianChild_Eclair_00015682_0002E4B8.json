    "Eclair is a boy who runs the Spelunkers restaurant inside Little Lamplight in Fallout 3.",
    "Previously a casual member of the scavenging team, Eclair is now Little Lamplight's resident chef, cooking and serving cave fungus to the other children.",
    "Eclair's disdain for the fungus is to a point where he jokes that if they had a brahmin in town, some of the children might now consider eating its turds.",
    "Eclair has taken it upon himself to experiment with his cookbook scraps new ways to spice up the cave fungus, the results of which were unfortunate enough to earn him his nickname after making a fungus eclair, and now he advises others against trying this.",
    "Aside from his exasperation with the food shortage, Eclair will express annoyance over jokes about his name, asking that the Lone Wanderer not laugh when he introduces himself, or responding tiredly that he is indeed in charge of the food.",
    "Apart from the gunshot wound on his foot, Eclair is also missing an eye, which according to Bumble was because a \"monster\" from Vault 87 bit him in the face; he has also told her that monsters are either green or have more than two arms.",
    "Eclair spends most of his time behind a counter in his restaurant, \"Spelunkers\" in Little Lamplight. He can also sometimes be seen around the restaurant when there are no other non-player characters in the area."
