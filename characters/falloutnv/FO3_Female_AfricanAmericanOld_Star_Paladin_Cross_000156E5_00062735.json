    "Star Paladin Cross is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel residing in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3. She is a possible companion of the Lone Wanderer.",
    "It is well known among the Brotherhood's members that Cross is actually a cyborg; she no longer has a need to eat or sleep. This was the result of Scribe Reginald Rothchild performing an operation in order to save her life after she was gravely wounded while protecting Elder Owyn Lyons in the past.",
    "Sometime after the Brotherhood arrived in the Capital Wasteland, they were approached to provide protection for the scientists of Project Purity; Cross in particular helped to guard the endeavor from when it was in its infancy in 2257. However, following the death of a lead scientist, Catherine, in childbirth, the progress ground to a halt. With super mutant attacks increasing,",
    "By 2277, Cross' service to the Brotherhood has led to her achieving the rank of star paladin as well as holding the title of Keeper of the ARM. She primarily acts as seneschal (steward) to Elder Lyons.",
    "Being the second highest-ranked soldier in the Brotherhood (behind Sentinel Sarah Lyons), Cross answers only to the elder, who has given her leave to pursue Project Purity's restoration as she sees fit.",
    "In traveling with the Lone Wanderer, Cross can express how she knew James well;",
    "† Cross wears a unique variant of power armor, editor ID FollowersOutfitCross, form ID 00066c73, though it does not have better statistics than any other power armor and is simply called power armor.",
    "Star Paladin Cross appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter, Fallout Shelter Online, and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare."
