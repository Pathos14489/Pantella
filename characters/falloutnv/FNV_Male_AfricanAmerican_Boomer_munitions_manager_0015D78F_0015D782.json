    "The Boomer munitions manager is the weapons stock manager for the Boomers living at Nellis Air Force Base in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "He keeps the armory for the Boomers at Nellis Air Force Base and can be found in the mess hall & munitions storage. The player character can trade with him after Pearl gives permission. The permission is automatically granted after the player character has gained a reputation of at least \"Accepted\" with the Boomers. He resets just like the rest of the vendors, every Wednesday and Sunday.",
    "The Boomer munitions manager stocks explosives ammo such as grenades, mines, 40mm grenades, 25mm grenades, and missiles.",
