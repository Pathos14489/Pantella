    "Tammy Hargrave is an alcoholic resident of Rivet City in Fallout 3.",
    "Tammy is a sour, middle-aged alcoholic,",
    "Tammy considers herself better than most of Rivet City's citizens, Her emotional abuse and general neglect has caused James to act out his problems with light thievery and abuse of his own to his only friend C.J. Young.",
    "Should James have been convinced to runaway in a forlorn attempt at attention from loved ones he'll take C.J. with him.",
    "Tammy is the mother of James Hargrave, and an emotionally abusive alcoholic who wouldn't mind selling him into slavery. Her husband, who she married because she was desperate, died in the wasteland. She uses this as an excuse to treat her son horribly, often emotionally abusing him. Due to her actions she has a poor reputation among the citizenry of Rivet City.",
    "She can be found in the common bedroom area on the midship deck, in The Muddy Rudder, or occasionally the marketplace."
