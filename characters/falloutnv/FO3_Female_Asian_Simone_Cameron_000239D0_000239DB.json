    "Simone Cameron is a guard living at the Temple of the Union in 2277.",
    "Simone was part of a mercenary crew before slavers took her. She was a slave for only seven months, feigning obedience and escaping as soon as the opportunity presented itself.",
    "Despite the Fallout 3 Official Game Guide labeling Simone as being a raider prior to her enslavement, her in-game dialogue with the Lone Wanderer notes that she was, instead, a mercenary.",
    "Cameron's name is a reference to Simon Cameron, who served as President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of War from 1861 to 1862."
