    "Knight Artemis is a Brotherhood of Steel member who resides in the Citadel in Fallout 3.",
    "Artemis is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel who has recently returned to the Citadel from a scouting mission that involved clearing the area surrounding Galaxy News Radio. When not involved in scouting missions and area sweeps, he mentors initiates.",
    "He is cynical about the Brotherhood's presence in the Capital Wasteland and sees it as a drainage of resources, one that has gotten several of his close friends killed or influenced them to join the Brotherhood Outcasts; his cynicism is further exacerbated by the reemergence of the Enclave.",
    "Artemis claims to have killed more \"uglies\" than every member of the Lyons' Pride combined, and suggests that the Lone Wanderer use Abraxo and some water to remove super mutant blood stains from their armor.",
    "Knight Artemis patrols the Citadel."
