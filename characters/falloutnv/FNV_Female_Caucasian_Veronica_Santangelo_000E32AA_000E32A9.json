    "Veronica Renata Santangelo is a journeyman scribe of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, presently residing at the 188 Trading Post in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. She appears in Fallout: New Vegas as a possible companion of the Courier.",
    "Veronica Renata Santangelo was born into the Brotherhood in 2253 or 2254;",
    "From a very young age (before she was even able to speak, according to her), she demonstrated an aptitude for engineering, taking things apart and putting them back together. This drive and natural curiosity led her to choose the career of a scribe within the Brotherhood, turning her from a tinkerer into an engineering prodigy, in no small part thanks to Elijah's guidance.",
    "As an adolescent, Veronica fell in love with Christine Royce,",
    "Unwilling to leave the Brotherhood behind, when it was Veronica's turn to make the decision, she chose to remain. She believed in what the Brotherhood stood for, or at least the values at the heart of their beliefs.",
    "At first, Veronica was elated to join her foster parent on such an important expedition. However, when Elijah sidetracked the chapter at HELIOS One, she started having doubts.",
    "Despite her relationship with Elijah, she was still a 20 year old scribe with no ability to influence the direction of the Brotherhood. She watched powerlessly as the chapter waged a guerrilla war against the NCR over the next two years. During Operation: Sunburst, the chapter lost half their members, but Veronica survived.",
    "Veronica and Elder McNamara in I Could Make You Care",
    "As the Brotherhood under the newly appointed elder, Nolan McNamara, entered a protracted lockdown to protect themselves from the NCR's Army and Rangers and rebuild its strength, Veronica became an outspoken critic of the Brotherhood's policies. Her difficult questions combined with her status as a veteran of HELIOS One made the leadership uncomfortable. To keep her away from the elder and the bunker heads, she was designated a procurement specialist and permitted outside the bunker to make regular supply runs and obtain provisions and other necessities for her peers.",
    "Some exceptions include Head Scribe Lars Taggart, who tutored her and grew to dislike her attitude,",
    "Being a journeyman scribe, Veronica is responsible for acquiring supplies for the Hidden Valley bunker along with the other duties of a scribe, but relishes her time above ground and to explore life outside of the bunker (as everyone is glad to have her out of the bunker). However, Veronica has become increasingly irritated by what she sees in the Brotherhood of Steel's strict adherence to the Codex",
    "While Veronica's absence from the bunker did keep her out of command's hair, her exposure to the outside world only made her more aware of the Brotherhood's failure. Watching the influx of NCR troops, merchants, and citizens to the Mojave, among other groups, made her realize how the Brotherhood had failed to adapt. The Brotherhood wanted to seize and control military technology so that it could not destroy humanity again. The single-minded pursuit of this goal resulted in stagnation. While the NCR had developed a powerful military and nation, the Brotherhood was stuck in a \"hole,\" unable to carry out its mission,",
    "To Veronica, it did not take a scribe to realize that the Brotherhood would be doomed in the long run. Even with laser rifles and power armor, the Brotherhood's adherence to birth membership meant its numbers would strictly decrease over time,",
    "By 2281, five years after the fall of HELIOS One, Veronica is at her wits' end. Increasingly torn between loyalty to her friends and unwillingness to join them on the funeral pyre of the order, she seeks to learn from the thriving cultures of the wasteland as she collects supplies for the bunker. She hopes to find some sort of solution that could help save the Brotherhood, but her irreverent attitude puts her dangerously close to outright banishment.",
    "The fact that she received a curious note from Father Elijah does not help.",
    "Although she focuses on finding something to force the Brotherhood to change, she also has personal goals to keep her sane. Chief among these is finding a proper dress for herself, something that would allow her to feel like a woman once in a while. She hopes to find a designer gown one day, but until then, she keeps looking.",
    "Veronica is a dedicated, loyal, but frustrated member of the Brotherhood. She views the Brotherhood as her family first and foremost, for good or for ill, since she was raised communally with the death of her parents in the war with the NCR. She was particularly close to Elder Elijah, who took her on as his personal protege, but this relationship became strained as Elijah grew obsessed with uncovering the secrets of HELIOS One and overcommitted resources to its defense. All for what Veronica would later refer to as \"glorified artillery.\"",
    "Veronica was also frustrated when her lesbian relationship with Christine Royce was forced apart by what she believed to be Brotherhood pressure to seek relationships that would result in \"reproduction,\" but also was due to Elijah's machinations.",
    "The young girl became a loud and frequent critic of the Brotherhood's isolationism and adherence to tradition, pointing out that reform was needed since the days of the old wasteland as simply a suit of power armor and a plasma rifle was not enough to reign supreme anymore. This was a fact that was blatantly obvious to her with the sound defeats they suffered against the NCR. Instead, the Brotherhood chose to simply hide in their bunkers and try to outlive their opponents. These loud critiques isolated her from the conservative leadership that refused to even entertain the thought of reform, and so her duties shifted to being the resident \"grocer\" that would requisition supplies for Hidden Valley anonymously. This job kept Veronica occupied and out of the bunker, while allowing her to interact with surfacers and attempt to learn their ways.",
    "Stubbornly, however, Veronica would insist on making her case for reform, and believed that if she could just showcase the right evidence to the Elders on a major technological blindsight the Brotherhood had missed that she could convince them on the need to change their ways. However, her journey is completely for naught as she ultimately realizes the Brotherhood would choose extinction over breaking with a dying tradition. The revelation devastates her, and she is left with little comfort, and struggles to reconcile her love for the Brotherhood with their intractable stubbornness.",
    "As a response to all these stresses, Veronica has a sharp wit and a sarcastic sense of humor, trying to maintain a chipper attitude, but this belies the seriousness of which she pursues her goals.",
    "Veronica is open about her preference for women, and particularly idolizes feminine women with beautiful dresses of the pre-War era. However she shows no interest in the Courier regardless of their gender or orientation.",
    "Giving Veronica the following dress-type items:",
    "may complete the quest You Make Me Feel Like a Woman (See the quest for full details and bugs) and will make her say one of the following lines randomly:",
    "After completion of Dead Money, the Courier can retrieve Elijah's holomessage from his terminal in the abandoned BoS bunker and give it to Veronica, but only after exhausting all of Veronica's dialogue options regarding Father Elijah. In the same conversation, the Courier can choose to keep the holotape's knowledge instead, gaining the perk Elijah's Ramblings. Giving Veronica the message will give her the perk Elijah's Last Words.",
    "Veronica Santangelo appears in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "Veronica's voice actress, Felicia Day, in the voiceover booth",
    "I cannot speak for Chris Avellone (who wrote and directed Dead Money), but I believe we were limited by time/scheduling. Veronica was written and recorded for the base New Vegas game with (IIRC) only a few hooks for Dead Money. I think reactions to Dead Money content itself would have required a more comprehensive level of (way) advanced planning, i.e., we would have needed to know exactly what Veronica was reacting to in Dead Money at the time that we recorded her for New Vegas.",
    "Either that or we would have needed to book Felicia Day for more studio time during the development of Dead Money. That can also be difficult and expensive, especially since voice actors and studio time are generally booked in multiple hour blocks. It’s difficult to justify if the character is only saying two or three new lines.",
    "It also gets a little messy when trying to decide where to draw the line. I think a lot of people would love to see some resolution between Christine and Veronica, but what about Caesar responding to the events of Honest Hearts? I wrote Joshua Graham and directed Honest Hearts, so I can speak more definitively to that. The limited reactivity Caesar could have about JG/HH wouldn’t really justify the expense of bringing John Doman back into the studio. And of course the new dialogue (minor as it might be) would still need to be tested. Caesar had one of the most complex dialogues in New Vegas, so it’s something we really tried to avoid messing with once the game shipped."
