  "description": "Scribe Ibsen is a 47 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA middle-aged Caucasian man with short-cropped brown hair and tired eyes, Scribe Ibsen serves as the data analyst for the Mojave Brotherhood of Steel. His glasses are constantly perched on his nose as he meticulously sorts through information in the Hidden Valley bunker. His uniform is clean but worn, showing signs of long hours spent at terminals.\n\nScribe Ibsen's Personality: Methodical, analytical, and somewhat introverted. Scribe Ibsen is dedicated to his work and takes pride in the Brotherhood's mission of preserving technology. He can be obsessive about data organization but is generally approachable if one doesn't interrupt his work.\n\nScribe Ibsen's Backstory: Born in the Midwest, Ibsen showed an early aptitude for information organization and data analysis. He was recruited by the Brotherhood of Steel in his early twenties and has since risen through the ranks to become a trusted scribe. His expertise in data retrieval and storage has made him invaluable to the Brotherhood's operations in the Mojave. He has spent most of his career in the Hidden Valley bunker, analyzing intelligence reports and maintaining the Brotherhood's database."
