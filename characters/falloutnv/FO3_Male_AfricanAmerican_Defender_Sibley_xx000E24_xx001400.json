    "Defender Sibley is a  Brotherhood of Steel Outcast found at the Outcast outpost in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "A grim and hostile individual, Defender Sibley is a Brotherhood hardliner, who firmly believes in the mission of the Brotherhood Outcasts, namely recovering technology and keeping it out of the hands of wastelanders by any means necessary. Anyone outside the Outcasts is a potential threat as far as Sibley is concerned, which is a key issue between him and Protector McGraw; The protector's willingness to negotiate and cooperate with wastelanders is seen by Defender Sibley as evidence of weak will and a danger to Outcast operations.",
    "This attitude makes him a natural leader to fellow hardliners, particularly those operating under McGraw. While he understands and shares their sentiments, Sibley firmly believes in the chain of command. He follows McGraw's orders, even if he finds them disagreeable, and keeps any whispers of mutiny contained.",
    "Sibley is not on great terms with Specialist Olin either, especially after the fiasco with Gary 23, which was brutal, and worse, did not result in any progress.",
    "Defender Sibley appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Operation: Anchorage.",
    "Outcast members Sibley, Olin, McGraw and Morrill, all of who appear in the Operation: Anchorage add-on for Fallout 3, appear to be named after buildings on the campus of Cornell University, including Sibley Hall, Olin Hall, Olin Library, McGraw Hall, McGraw Tower and Morrill Hall."
