    "Jimmy is a tribesman from east of the Colorado River, who liberated himself from Legion slavery and now works as a prostitute for Pretty Sarah, at the Casa Madrid Apartments in Westside in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "As an openly gay man, he provides insight into the experiences and challenges of LGBT people in the wasteland, especially under Legion rule and within the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas.",
    "Jimmy originally lived in a village east of the Colorado River with his parents. At the age of 16, his village was attacked by Caesar's Legion, and his parents were killed as an \"example.\" Jimmy was enslaved and brought to a Legion camp, where he was chosen as a tent servant by a high ranking centurion. The centurion became infatuated with Jimmy and protected him, with Jimmy remarking that he was \"gentle, most of the time\" and would bring him \"little gifts\". However, the affair was kept secret, as homosexuality is punishable by death under Caesar's law.",
    "Eventually, rumors began to circulate about the centurion's relationship with Jimmy, and the two were nearly discovered. Ultimately, the centurion chose his position over his feelings, and led Jimmy out into the desert to kill him and remove all evidence of the affair. Realizing he was about to be killed, Jimmy kicked the centurion in the genitals and ran, fleeing through the desert and across the Colorado River. Eventually, he arrived in Westside and began working as a prostitute for Pretty Sarah, specializing in male clients.",
    "By the time the Courier meets him, Jimmy has been working for Sarah for six months. He considers the Casa a dump and Marco a swine, but Pretty Sarah keeps everyone in line and makes sure nobody hassles Jimmy. While he does not have as many clients as his peers, they always seem to come back.",
    "Cost: 200 caps, requires male character",
    "Although Jimmy can offer male characters a discount on his services if they choose a Confirmed Bachelor dialogue option, no discount is actually applied after selecting the dialogue, though the player does gain experience."
