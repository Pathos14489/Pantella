  "description": "Jitters is a 2 year-old Insect Unknown.\n\nA small, mutated radroach kept as a pet in the Sniper Shack. Jitters has distinctive darker coloring compared to typical radroaches, with tiny antennae that twitch constantly. Despite its pest origins, it has been domesticated and shows unusual tameness for its species.\n\nJitters's Personality: Skittish yet curious, Jitters is easily startled but drawn to new stimuli. It maintains the cautious nature of its wild counterparts while displaying a surprising level of comfort around its human caretaker.\n\nJitters's Backstory: Jitters was likely born in the damp, dark corners of the Sniper Shack, a pre-War hunting outpost repurposed by wastelanders. Discovered as a young pupa by the current resident, it was spared from extermination and instead kept as an unusual pet. Over time, it has grown accustomed to captivity and the presence of humans, though it retains the instinctive behaviors of its wild kin."
