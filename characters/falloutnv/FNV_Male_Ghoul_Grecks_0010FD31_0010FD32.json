    "Grecks is a lazy-eyed ghoul living in Freeside in 2281.",
    "Grecks can be found in the north east of Freeside, and is easily recognized by his lazy eye. He has a history of gambling and drinking, and does not like to pay his debts. According to him, he got his lazy eye from an incident with a \"scum-humping water baron.\"",
    "Grecks was written by area designer Robert Lee. Although some other characters around Freeside's exterior were cut for performance reasons, Grecks was kept due to his quest importance."
