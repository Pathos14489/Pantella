    "Sally is a child abductee aboard Mothership Zeta in the year 2277.",
    "Sally and her sister were abducted shortly after the bombs dropped in 2077. Her parents were killed almost immediately after the war, leaving the two girls to themselves. After the abduction, the girls were separated, and Sally never learned that her sister died during one of the aliens' many experiments. She has blocked out most of the bad things that happened to her and is now a fixture in the lower levels of the ship, repeatedly escaping custody and exploring the ship's lower level. She has a degree of insight into the workings of the Mothership and the motives of the aliens that nobody else possesses.",
    "The fact that Sally was abducted during the Great War makes her more than 200 years old. Sally also offers random alien items once every few hours, should the Lone Wanderer request them.",
    "Not of This World/Among the Stars/This Galaxy Ain't Big Enough...: Sally assists the Lone Wanderer throughout the Mothership Zeta quests by using her skills to open doors or to provide information as they move through the ship.",
    "Sally appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Mothership Zeta."
