    "Shawna is a citizen of the Republic of Dave in 2277. She also runs the Museum of Dave and is in charge of the schooling.",
    "At the age of 17, she is Dave's eldest daughter. She has been raised to be a fighter and knows how to survive if the need ever arises for her to leave the Republic. She is supportive of her father.",
    "Shawna, as curator for the Museum of Dave, handles the museum budget. By passing a Speech check, she can be convinced to buy any item for its base value to her. The budget of the museum is 700 caps. Items sold to her will not actually be displayed in the museum.",
    "Shawna will be very distressed if anyone besides Dave wins the election, but she nonetheless remains in the Republic.",
    "So, I'll just get started on the tour of the museum then. To my far right is the baby carriage that our great leader slept in as a newborn baby. Unlike most babies, he never cried and his poop didn't stink. Dave had 8 siblings and made his own baseball team. The team was so good, in fact, the Wasteland team was so scared it never showed up to compete. The briefcase is the very one Dave took with him when he became fed up with the poor ways that his father ran the nation. Dave brought back many items from the Wasteland. It was artifacts like these that amassed the Republic's great wealth. Dave collects many war collectibles, including holotapes and war weaponry. This globe represents the whole planet that Dave traversed. Don't let its size fool you, the world is at least fifty times bigger than this. I don't know who put that tire there. These weapons were used against the USA before the bombs fell. Dave probably acquired these when he walked to China. Dave is a world-renowned marksman, known for shooting an apple out of the hand of a Raider from across the Potomac. Mounted to my left is the very head of the slain Deathclaw that Dave encountered during his quest through the Wastes. I know what you're thinking, and no, that's not a Brahmin skull. Brahmin have two heads, so there'd have to be two skulls for it to be Brahmin. Please, no touching. And that's the tour! I hope you enjoyed it!"
