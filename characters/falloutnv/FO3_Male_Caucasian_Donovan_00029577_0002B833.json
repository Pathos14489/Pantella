    "Donovan is the Reilly's Rangers engineer first seen on the rooftop of the Statesman Hotel in Fallout 3.",
    "Donovan is the technical expert of the Rangers, with a proficiency in hacking, repairing weapons and armor, and working on electronics.",
    "Although Donovan joined the team following high praise from Reilly's contact in the Brotherhood of Steel, and she thinks his loyalty is genuine, she still possesses some doubts; regardless, she is of the impression that he is a \"good man,\" and instead believes that both his broader engineering knowledge and his trust will merely take more time to work on and fully gauge.",
    "Despite having a smaller build, he can hold his own in fights as well as any of the other Rangers, and can graciously state he has the Lone Wanderer's back if they end up in a firefight together again.",
    "When not on a mission, he is frequently getting into verbal and physical fights with Brick, which Reilly constantly has to break up.",
    "Donovan appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 If Donovan dies in the random encounter, the rest of the Rangers may turn hostile."
