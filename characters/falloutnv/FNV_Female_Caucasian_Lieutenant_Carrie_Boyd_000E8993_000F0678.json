    "Lieutenant Carrie Boyd is an military police officer at Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "Carrie Boyd is highly observant and notes anyone who comes into McCarran,",
    "Carrie Boyd is an avid smoker and retains a sardonic and laconic demeanor in spite of (or perhaps because of) the amount of work on her plate. But Boyd is far more sadistic of an officer than her demeanor lets on, however. As mentioned before, she finds the humanitarian laws pertaining to the human rights of POWs as constraining and takes a wry pleasure in the act",
    "Boyd loathes Caesar's Legion like any NCR officer would and is invested in NCR's propaganda against the Followers of the Apocalypse, questioning whether the Followers as a whole are doing more harm than good.",
    "After completing Silus Treatment, she will move around the building, but can often be found in her office on the east side of the second floor."
