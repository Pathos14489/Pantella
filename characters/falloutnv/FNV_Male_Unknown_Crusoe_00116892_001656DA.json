    "Crusoe is a dead investigator found in one of the Ultra-Luxe hotel rooms in 2281.",
    "Hired by an unnamed groom to investigate the disappearance of his bride at the Ultra-Luxe, private detective Crusoe had rented a room by the White Glove Society member Mortimer, to stay in while performing the investigation. His contact arranged for him to meet an informant in the steam room at 4:00 PM, to receive information regarding the White Gloves' potential return to cannibalism and ties to recent kidnappings.",
    "Unaware that Mortimer has hired an assassin to silence any he suspects knows of or is plotting against his movement to return his organization back to their old ways, Crusoe failed to report for the meeting. He is found dead in his hotel room, the victim of a brutal attack.",
    "Beyond the Beef: A matchbook found on Crusoe's body, which was given to him by his client, informs the detective to meet a contact in the Ultra-Luxe steam room at 4:00 PM.",
    "Without the Wild Wasteland trait, he is replaced by Jay Barnes."
