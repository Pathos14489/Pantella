    "Captain Parker is an NCR officer in charge of the Aerotech Office Park in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "As the head of the refugee camp, it is up to Captain Parker and Doctor Bert Gunnarsson to ensure that people down on their luck have somewhere to go to. Although he is seemingly perpetually short on people and supplies, he tries his best to make the park livable.",
    "The uphill struggle makes him more than a little high-strung. Parker is particularly haunted by the memory of a blonde girl with a stuffed bear. She did not speak much, but he remembered her when she and her family suddenly disappeared."
