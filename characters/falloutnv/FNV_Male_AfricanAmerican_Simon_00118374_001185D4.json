    "Simon is the door guard and face of the Van Graff family living in Freeside in 2281.",
    "Simon has been with the Van Graff family for a couple years and is responsible for guarding the door at the Silver Rush. His duties include weapon checks and turning away drunks and addicts while keeping a very professional, authoritarian attitude.",
    "Xbox 360 If a save is done and afterwards Simon attacks the player, caused by the player attacking a civilian in Freeside, a bug may appear in a reload of previous save where Simon still attacks the player without said civilian attack performed. This causes the player to automatically fail the Birds of a Feather quest. "
