    "Irving Cheng is an inhabitant of Tenpenny Tower in 2277, who is married to Tiffany Cheng.",
    "Irving, a wealthy elderly man with a secret identity, believes himself to be the direct descendant of Chairman Cheng, the leader of the People's Republic of China before the War. Prideful of his assumed lineage, he insists on addressing himself and all others as \"comrade,\" and is embarrassed by his own given name, as it fails to reflect his imagined heritage.",
    "In his computer terminal, he writes that his father was one of the leading officers in the Chinese Army. He also writes about his \"plans\" for creating a communist society in Tenpenny Tower, which he terms the \"Tenpenny Commune.\" Cheng heavily implies he is prejudiced against ghouls, as with many of the other Tenpenny residents.",
    "Comrade Cheng can be overheard speaking with Susan Lancaster, revealing why his wife despises him so much. Comrade Cheng is also having an affair with Susan Lancaster."
