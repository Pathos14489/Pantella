    "They carry a flamer and wear a unique raider arclight helmet called \"Torcher's mask\" and a set of raider badlands armor. They have nothing else in their inventory unless the Lone Wanderer has the Lawbringer perk, then Torcher will also carry a finger.",
    "Torcher is immediately and always hostile towards intruders. As they are on the list of enslavable characters, they can be enslaved and/or turned friendly through the use of the Mesmetron.",
