  "description": "Gunny is a 35 year-old Caucasian Male.\n\nA hardened raider miniboss who oversees operations in the Springvale school library. Clad in makeshift leather armor with metal plates, Gunny wields a combat shotgun and has a scar running across his left cheek. He stands at an intimidating height, with a muscular build and a permanent scowl etched on his face.\n\nGunny's Personality: Cruel, aggressive, and pragmatic. Gunny takes pleasure in intimidation and is fiercely loyal to his raider gang's leader. He's quick-tempered and won't hesitate to use violence to maintain control over his territory.\n\nGunny's Backstory: Gunny was once a resident of a small settlement near Springvale before being forced out by raiders. Rather than becoming a victim, he joined the raider ranks, where his combat skills and ruthless nature allowed him to quickly rise through the hierarchy. He now serves as the miniboss of the Springvale school raiders, overseeing operations in the library and protecting the entrance to their leader's quarters."
