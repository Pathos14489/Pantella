    "Saint James is a slaver living in Westside in 2281.",
    "Saint James, together with his partner Dermot, used to work as a prospector scavenging around New Vegas, but in secret has turned to slavery by selling refugees as slaves to the Fiends.",
    "On top of his psychosis, Saint James is an active pedophile. He is only kept manageable by a teddy bear from a little blonde girl that they kidnapped, originally part of one of the missing families from Aerotech Office Park, that Dermot bribed him with to keep him away from the \"merchandise.\"",
    "Keeping himself from molesting children is not the only use for the teddy bear, as it has been a regular accessory to his sessions with Sweetie, his favorite prostitute."
