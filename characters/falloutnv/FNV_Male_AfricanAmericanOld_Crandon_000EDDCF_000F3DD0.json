  "description": "Crandon is a 45 year-old African American Male.\n\nA community leader and watchman in North Vegas Square, Crandon maintains order and protects the settlement's residents from the dangers of the wasteland.\n\nCrandon's Personality: Pragmatic, protective, and authoritative, Crandon takes his role as community leader seriously. He's cautious but fair, willing to make tough decisions for the good of the Square.\n\nCrandon's Backstory: Born before the Great War, Crandon survived the apocalypse and eventually found himself in the ruins of Vegas. When Mr. House cleared out squatters from the Strip in 2274, Crandon joined others in establishing North Vegas Square as a safe haven. Taking on a leadership role, he works alongside Jules to protect their community from threats in the wasteland."
