    "Vikia is a Pitt raider in Uptown in 2277.",
    "A skilled sniper, Vikia is extremely condescending towards all others, especially current or former Pitt slaves. Unlike many of the other Pitt raiders, Vikia is strictly unimpressed with the Lone Wanderer’s accomplishments fighting in the arena.",
    "Vikia can generally be found on the roof of the raider barracks, engaging in target practice with her sniper rifle on several rows of bottles in the building window across from her location.",
    "Vikia appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "Vikia's name is in reference to a Carnegie Mellon University project of the same name VIKIA or Very Intense Know It All. Since she is named after an AI, Vikia is also the only raider to carry a fission battery, sensor module, and scrap metal."
