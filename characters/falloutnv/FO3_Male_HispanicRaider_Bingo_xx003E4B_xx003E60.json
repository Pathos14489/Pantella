  "description": "Bingo is a 62 year-old Hispanic Male.\n\nAn elderly member of the Pitt raiders, Bingo is a weathered figure with tired eyes and a constant, confused expression. His body shows the signs of a hard life in the wasteland, with scars and weathered skin telling stories of past conflicts. Despite his age, he remains a raider, though his mental state appears deteriorated. Bingo can typically be found at Vertigo Bar and Grill or patrolling the upper levels of The Pitt Downtown.\n\nBingo's Personality: Confused and disoriented, Bingo appears to be suffering from some form of mental decline or radiation sickness. He has limited cognitive function, often stuck in repetitive behaviors. Despite his affiliation with the raiders, he doesn't display the typical aggression of his peers, instead appearing lost in his own world. There's a sense of melancholy about him, as if he remembers better times.\n\nBingo's Backstory: Born before the Great War, Bingo survived the apocalypse in the Pittsburgh area and eventually fell in with the raiders who would form The Pitt. In his younger days, he was a more functional member of the group, participating in raids and slaving operations. However, as he aged, the harsh conditions of the wasteland took their toll. Years of radiation exposure, substance abuse, and the general brutality of raider life have left him mentally diminished. He now serves as a minor figure in the raider hierarchy, more of a mascot than an effective member."
