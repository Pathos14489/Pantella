    "Greasy Johnny is a leader of a gang called the Greasers living in the north sewers of New Vegas in 2281.",
    "A rude gang leader, Johnny, and his Greasers have taken up residence in the New Vegas sewers and harass the locals within and the residents of North Vegas Square. Although not a formidable bunch, the Greasers have been making enough noise that Crandon, a local guard, sends the Courier to get rid of them.",
    "Greasy Johnny was written by area designer Jorge Salgado, who also worked on the quest Someone to Watch Over Me."
