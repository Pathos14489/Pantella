    "Silus is a centurion of Caesar's Legion, captured during battle and brought to Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "An exceptional member of the Legion, Silus is unique not in bravery, but in his insight and intelligence, as despite Legion indoctrination, he has managed to retain freedom of thought and skills of critical observation. He earned the rank of centurion through bravery and devotion, serving Caesar unquestioningly for years. Among many, he and his men wiped out countless NCR patrols to allow Legion operatives to move freely,",
    "He was not blind to Caesar's degenerating health, or his own worth. Before his last mission, he waited for three days until his leader's headache subsided, despite the time-critical nature of his assignment. The delay resulted in Silus' centuria being ambushed and routed by the NCR.",
    "Silus recognized Captain Ronald Curtis upon being brought into the base, having met him years earlier during the latter's frumentarii training. He did not know his current name,",
    "While Lt. Boyd tries, in vain, to pry some useful information from him, Silus continues to believe that he is still a loyal officer of the Legion, as he refused to kill one of its greatest soldiers (himself) and did not divulge even the slightest bit of information.",
    "Silus Treatment",
    "Silus Treatment: Silus is held captive in Camp McCarran, and the NCR is attempting to interrogate him. He will not give information to the NCR, and interrogator Carrie Boyd is looking for help. She informs the player character that the NCR does not allow torture of prisoners. They can suggest a truth serum, beating the prisoner, or calling him names. Silus may also be freed, resulting in a few special dialogue lines from Caesar.",
    "Silus has a low intelligence dialogue option, though it's limited to a single line.",
    "Silus directly translates to \"snub-nosed\" in Latin.",
    "Frumentarii: Alerio · Cato Hostilius · Gabban · Karl · Picus · Disguised frumentarius · Ulysses (formerly)\nConsul: M. Licinius Crassus · M. Scribonius Libo Drusus (of the consul)"
