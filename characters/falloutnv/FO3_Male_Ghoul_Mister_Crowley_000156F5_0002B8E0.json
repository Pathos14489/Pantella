    "Mister Crowley is a ghoul resident of Underworld in the Capital Wasteland around 2277.",
    "Mister Crowley is a ghoul, who transformed over 20 years ago",
    "Crowley and four other mercenaries - Dave, Jeff Strayer, Dukov, and Tara - were sent to Fort Constantine by Allistair Tenpenny to retrieve a rare weapon. During the mission, Crowley was locked in a room full of feral ghouls by Dukov, who wanted to increase his own share of the payout. Crowley survived the imprisonment and harbors a passionate resentment toward those who left him behind.",
    "Mister Crowley can usually be found in either the Ninth Circle or his bed at Carol's Place in Underworld. He usually sleeps until 12 PM.",
