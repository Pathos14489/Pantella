    "Paladin Tristan is a member of Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel in 2277.",
    "Tristan was involved with the original expedition that found the Pentagon ruins with Elder Lyons. He has trained Sarah Lyons since she was young and he has a professional relationship with her. Tristan is loyal to Lyons and follows his direction and ideals of the Brotherhood's future closely. Tristan is wise and has a serious nature.",
    "Tristan has climbed through the ranks of the Brotherhood of Steel and attained the status of a paladin. He acts as an operation specialist, planning many of the offensives in defeating the Enclave in the Capital Wasteland. Tristan is responsible for the daily operations of the Citadel and he helps assist Paladin Gunny with training new members. He is often found wandering the Citadel's main control room area, which is the old bay for Liberty Prime.",
    "He approved the loadout of Squad 7 for the assault on Adams Air Force Base.",
    "He is the acting field commander of the Brotherhood forces in light of Sarah Lyons being unable to fight after the events at the purifier, and is in charge of all Brotherhood operations involving the Lone Wanderer and Liberty Prime, the first mission in the main Broken Steel questline.",
    "Paladin Tristan appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel."
