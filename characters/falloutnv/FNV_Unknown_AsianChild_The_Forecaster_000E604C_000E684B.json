    "The Forecaster, real name Clay, is a young clairvoyant psychic living under the overpass at the 188 Trading Post in 2281.",
    "A young boy sitting on a bedroll, surrounded by a collection of assorted objects, will greet passersby that traverse underneath the 188's overpass. He can provide insight, or \"forecasts,\" into both the future and the past.",
    "If he utilizes this ability too much, he suffers from headaches and wears a psychic nullifier, which he refers to as his \"medicine,\" to avoid the side effects.",
    "The Courier can inquire as to why he is all alone at his young age, to which he will reply that his parents passed away, and he can only see them when he takes off his medicine, but is generally used to being on his own.",
    "PC Playstation 3 If the player character has the Mister Sandman perk, visits the Forecaster at night and tries to pickpocket him while he sleeps, he will get the murder option. However, the Forecaster is a kid and cannot die, but the player character still gets the bonus XP."
