    "Tenpenny Tower (optional)",
    "Mister Burke is an associate of Allistair Tenpenny operating in Megaton in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3.",
    "Little to nothing is known about Burke's past before 2277 save for that he and Tenpenny first met sometime around when Allistair first began accepting tenants and building a security force for Tenpenny Tower.",
    "It was originally an off-hand suggestion by Allistair, complaining about how the sight of Megaton ruined his view from his penthouse balcony (though he also suggested for the town to be vacated beforehand) that led to Burke coming to the shantytown and trying to learn more about its people and especially the bomb residing at its center.",
    "Mister Burke can typically be found sitting in a chair in Moriarty's Saloon prior to starting The Power of the Atom. After one accepts the fusion pulse charge and arms the bomb in Megaton, he will return to Tenpenny Tower and wait for the Lone Wanderer to rendezvous with him on the balcony. If Megaton is successfully destroyed, he will then spend all of his time in or on the same floor as his suite. However, in any outcome where the bomb does not go off and he is not killed, Burke will simply be disabled the next time the player leaves his current location cell, disappearing from the game.",
    "During the hallucination sequence of the quest Walking with Spirits in the Point Lookout add-on, a character named Mister Break will appear leaning against an atomic bomb, similar to the Megaton bomb but much larger. After interacting with him, the bomb explodes, and the Lone Wanderer wakes up outside of the sacred bog. The character looks identical to Mister Burke, including his clothing. When spoken to, he will respond in Tobar the Ferryman's voice and he gives a warning to not get up, saying \"you might hurt yourself.\".",
    "Mister Burke appears in Fallout 3 and Fallout Shelter."
