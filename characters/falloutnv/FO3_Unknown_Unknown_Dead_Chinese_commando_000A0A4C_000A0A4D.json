    "The dead Chinese commando is a deceased Chinese soldier who may be randomly encountered in Fallout 3.",
    "This man was a ghoulified Chinese commando and pilot who apparently became stranded in the United States of America after his aircraft crashed. He recorded a radio beacon to try to signal other friendly forces, but eventually died somewhere in the Capital Wasteland, with the beacon still active.",
    "There is no evidence in-game of the dead commando being a pilot. The name of the random encounter, as given by the Fallout 3 Official Game Guide, is the only source for this information. The unused subtitles for the Chinese radio beacon consist of the word \"Mayday\" repeated three times, which would allude to this idea, but the actual message used for the radio is completely different (see that page for more details)."
