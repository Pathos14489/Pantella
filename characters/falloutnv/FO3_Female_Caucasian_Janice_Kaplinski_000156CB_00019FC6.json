    "Janice Kaplinski (2247 or 2248 – 2277) is the chief botanist of Rivet City's science team in 2277.",
    "Born around 2247 to 2248,",
    "In her time under Dr. Li's tutelage, Janice has come into her own as an accomplished botanist. She is every bit the equal to Doctor Li and James in technical knowledge, though she lacks their genius or ambition.",
    "Personality-wise, Janice is a complete workaholic whose time is split between working in the lab, eating (always at the Weatherly Hotel, where she prefers to consume the science team's produce),",
    "In 2277, James, who had recently escaped Vault 101, visited the Rivet City science lab, hoping to enlist Doctor Li's support in reviving Project Purity. Doctor Li angrily refused to help him, claiming that she had moved on and too much time had passed.",
    "After the Lone Wanderer rescued James from Vault 112, and James and Doctor Li agreed to restart work on Project Purity, Janice was part of the team sent to help restart the purifier. She had high hopes for the project, having heard Doctor Li talk about it often, and eagerly looked forward to contributing, understanding that Doctor Li had secretly wanted to come back for many years.",
    "After the Lone Wanderer cleared the facility of its super mutant occupiers, Janice worked with the others to get the facility reoperational. However, while the Lone Wanderer was occupied, the Enclave stormed the facility and took her and James captive. Because James was refusing to hand over control of the purifier to them, Colonel Augustus Autumn executed Janice right in front of his, and the newly-arrived Lone Wanderer's, eyes.",
    "Janice interacts primarily with the members of the Rivet City science team, but even then only in a professional sense for the most part: she may be observed briefly talking to Henry Young or Garza regarding maintenance of the hydroponics, while she only engages in generic small talk with Anna Holt.",
    "Janice has a deeper bond with Doctor Li; her admiration for Doctor Li is a \"classic case of hero worship,\" and Janice has complete faith in Doctor Li and their work together. Meanwhile, she is also close friends with Doctor Preston, who treats her like the daughter he never had, often trying to motivate Janice to lighten up and interact with others more.",
    "Janice spends most of her day in the Rivet City science lab conducting experiments and talking with other lab personnel. At 7:00 a.m., she leaves the lab for the Weatherly Hotel to eat for around two hours before returning to the lab. She spends the entire day in the lab until leaving again for the Weatherly Hotel at night, with the exact time dependent on the day of the week:",
    "At 10 p.m., Janice goes to sleep in the science team's quarters inside the lab."
