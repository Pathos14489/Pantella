    "Comm Officer Lenk is a communications officer stationed at Ranger Station Foxtrot in 2281.",
    "Lenk is an NCR Ranger, filling the role of comm officer at station Foxtrot. She is very jumpy and becomes agitated when first talked to. She will tell the Courier that she was out on patrol near the Hoover Dam when her squad was ambushed by a Legion  squad, whereupon she was knocked unconscious. The Legion soldiers killed, butchered, and mutilated her squad but left her alive.",
    "Afterwards, still suffering from the traumatic experience, she no longer had the nerve she once did."
