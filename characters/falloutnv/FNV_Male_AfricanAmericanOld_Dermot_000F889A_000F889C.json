    "Dermot is a slaver living in Westside in 2281. Together with his partner Saint James, they have been kidnapping, murdering, and selling women and children into sexual slavery to the Fiends.",
    "A particularly rough and nasty person, Dermot puts on the persona of a hardworking and honorable prospector working salvage around New Vegas that likes to just relax on his off days. and selling them to the Fiends for a profit.",
    "Dermot has a particular mind for keeping his business profits straight and always updates a ledger on the businesses he's done before with prospecting and now (unwisely) for slaves. Along with documenting profits, Dermot also writes notes to himself about how to improve his craft, how to keep Saint James from getting to the children, and any other situations of note.",
    "On one particular case, Dermot and James had stolen a teddy bear from a little girl they kidnapped. Dermot bribed James with the bear as a means to keep his hands off the kids, as the Fiends \"don't want used goods\" and lets him sell for a higher price.",
    "Dermot has two unique items, having the only police hat and RobCo jumpsuit in Fallout: New Vegas."
