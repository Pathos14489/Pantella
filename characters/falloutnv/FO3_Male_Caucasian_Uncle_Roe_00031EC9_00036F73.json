    "Ernest \"Uncle\" Roe is the mayor of Canterbury Commons in 2277.",
    "Raised as part of trade caravan, by the time Ernest was twelve he possessed the ability to turn five caps into fifty with a series of trades. At the age of twenty he set out with his sister Daisy Roe and used the money acquired through his mercantile skills to finance the creation of the trading post of Canterbury Commons which caravans of the Capital Wasteland are known to stop at regularly.",
    "Now known as \"Uncle Roe,\" Ernest lives as the mayor of the town he help found, ensuring that the townsfolk he leads are able to eat with the food brought in by the caravans which frequent the town, hoping that his leadership will turn Canterbury Commons into a settlement on par with the likes of Rivet City.",
    "Along with being the mayor of the town, Ernest also cares for his nephew Derek Pacion, the son of his now deceased sister Daisy.",
    "Ernest Roe appears in ending slides.",
    "Playstation 3 Sometimes, Ernest's marker might lead you out of the map (e.g., north past Republic of Dave), thus making it impossible to finish the quest. "
