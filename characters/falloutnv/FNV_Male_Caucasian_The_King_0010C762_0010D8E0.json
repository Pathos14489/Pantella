    "The King is an Elvis impersonator who leads a gang called the \"Kings,\" operating out of the School of Impersonation located in southern Freeside in 2281.",
    "Born in the mid-2240s,",
    "Unlike other gangs in the Mojave Wasteland, the Kings are built on respect and do not look for their next fight or skirmish. Instead, the Kings are staunch anarchists that believe in complete personal freedom and that \"every man is a king in ",
    "The King's righthand man is Pacer, a childhood friend who sometimes tends to undermine his peaceful intentions. The Kings largely lets him do as he pleases unabated; tolerating his unscrupulous and violent tendencies towards strangers and squatters.",
    "The King also owns a cyberdog named Rex that he bought from a prospector a few years ago. Rex has always been nothing but a cyberhound, but The King has become concerned for Rex as his brain is beginning to degrade, and hopes that traveling with the Courier will allow him to get the help he needs and give him a little more bite and a little less bark.",
    "PC Playstation 3 If one speaks to The King about joining the Kings before the completion of his quest Nothin' But a Hound Dog, he might decline. Returning later after completing it, the option will not be reopened, (unless The King owes you a favor which is earned in another mission) and it will be thereafter impossible to join the King's gang. It is uncertain if this is a bug or intentional."
