    "Light Switch 01 is an artificial personality residing in the Sink in Big MT in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Both of the Sink's light switches were originally created by Doctor Mobius as part of a project to research the ability of projected light to enhance a subject's cognition, with the results apparently being successful; Light Switch 01's light mode could increase a subject's intellect,",
    "As with the rest of the Sink's appliances, the light switches were switched off when their personality modules were removed and thrown off the Sink's balcony by Doctor Klein, later being retrieved by Big MT staffers with Light Switch 01's ending up in the X-2 transmitter antenna array.",
    "There was originally a dialogue option for Light Switch 01 where she acknowledges the Courier finding the \"Smart Lights\" upgrade before it is installed, but this was not included in the final game.",
    "Light Switch 01 appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Travis Stout wrote Light Switch 01, in addition to all the other artificial personalities in the Sink.",
    "PC The \"Smart Light\" and \"Mood Light\" bonuses are applied to the player only when the player enter dialogue with the light switch and toggle such light. So, after the light is toggled, when the bonuses passes, just re-entering the Sink and be exposed to the light won't be enough to get the bonuses again. In this case, to get again the bonuses of the light already toggled, it is needed to first toggle any other type of light (even normal light or lights off will work) and then toggle to the desired light again."
