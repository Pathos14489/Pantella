    "Roy is a resident of Freeside, currently living at the Old Mormon Fort in 2281.",
    "Roy is one of the more elderly residents of Freeside. Roy is sharp witted, albeit in a surly way. He, Wayne and Farris just cashed in some scrap metal and decided to go to the Atomic Wrangler to try their luck at the slots when an attack occurred between two parties and they were caught in the crossfire.",
    "When the Courier thanks Wayne for information about who is attacking in Freeside during the quest G.I. Blues, the latter makes mention of one mutant being called \"Lou\" and something else with a T. He then mentions it was Lou Tenant.",
    "Putting the names of the three men together gets \"Roy Wayne Farris\" - real name of WWE Legend The Honky Tonk Man, who wrestled with an Elvis impersonator gimmick and is also the cousin of Jerry \"The King\" Lawler."
