    "Sarah Weintraub is the manager of the Vault 21 Hotel and Shop in 2281.",
    "Sarah grew up in Vault 21 when it was still an occupied Vault.",
    "With the Vault now in the possession of Mr. House,",
    "Sarah gained managerial custody over the remaining layer of Vault 21, which she soon developed into a hotel and gift shop. Business is usually good, with most of her clientele being well-to-do NCR tourists, honeymooners, and the occasional brahmin baron.",
    "One particular transaction by Sarah was the purchase of a unique rangefinder from a scavenger prior to the Brotherhood's occupation of HELIOS One.",
    "Both Sarah and her brother Sheldon suffer from agoraphobia, which makes it almost impossible for them to leave the Strip, let alone their homes (Vault 21 and Michael Angelo's workshop, respectively).",
    "Both Weintraub siblings were in the isolationist camp before Vault 21 opened. They both miss the old days",
    "Sarah tends to speak informally, using colloquialisms and slang from 1950s hot rod culture,",
    "Sarah Weintraub was written by Jorge Salgado, who was also the area designer on Vault 21."
