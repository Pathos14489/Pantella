    "Harkness, designation A3-21, is an android and Rivet City's security chief in the year 2277. His past is scattered across the Capital Wasteland for the Lone Wanderer to find and decide what fate will befall him.",
    "Rivet City's hard-nosed security chief, 35-year-old Harkness has a rough but fair demeanor. He is known for his very fair treatment of Rivet City's Hangar Deck and Upper Deck citizens, something which makes him popular with the former group.",
    "Harkness is a prototype Generation 3 synthetic humanoid, or \"synth,\" and the most advanced android ever created by the Institute as of 2277. \"Self determination is NOT a malfunction,\" as Harkness would later say in a holotape before escaping.",
    "While he successfully escaped the Commonwealth, he was hunted by the Synth Retention Bureau like any other escapee. He needed to get facial reconstruction surgery, an altered voice, and have his memories of being a synth suppressed/replaced with those of his new Harkness persona. This was all necessary to hinder the SRB's investigation and help him start a new life.",
    "Upon assuming his new persona, Harkness joined the Rivet City security force, eventually becoming its chief officer and member of the council.",
    "During the day, Harkness will be outside Flak 'N Shrapnel's weapon store in the Rivet City marketplace. He may be on the top floor of the bridge tower from midnight to 6 a.m. When meeting him for the first time, if the player character tells him they are going to leave, he'll be stuck at the entrance for the rest of the game. However, the player character can still walk past him without incident.",
    "Harkness appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter and Fallout Shelter Online."
