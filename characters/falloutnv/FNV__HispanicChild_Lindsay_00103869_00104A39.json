  "description": "Lindsay is a 10 year-old Hispanic Female.\n\nA young Hispanic girl with dark hair and bright eyes, Lindsay is one of the many children living within the Nellis Air Force Base. She can often be found playing with other children near the schoolhouse or in the children's barracks. Despite the harsh wasteland environment, she maintains a childlike innocence and curiosity about the world outside the base.\n\nLindsay's Personality: Energetic and curious, Lindsay is friendly but somewhat reserved around outsiders. She has a strong sense of community and loyalty to the Boomers, having grown up within their isolated society.\n\nLindsay's Backstory: Born and raised within the Nellis Air Force Base, Lindsay has never experienced the dangers of the Mojave Wasteland firsthand. Her parents are both Boomers, and she has been taught to view outsiders with suspicion. She spends her days attending classes in the schoolhouse and playing with other children in the barracks. The Boomers' strict lifestyle and emphasis on military discipline have shaped her understanding of the world, but she still dreams of seeing what lies beyond the base's walls."
