    "Jules is a wastelander and town guard for the people of North Vegas Square in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Little is known of Jules' past. By 2281, Jules is a seasoned survivalist and trained gunslinger, carrying a respect for others whom he considers fellow \"wasteland warriors;\"",
    "After eventually coming to the Mojave and settling down in North Vegas Square, Jules elected to stay and protect both the locals and traders passing through town from regular threats like hostile creatures and even worse groups like the Fiends.",
    "Jules views his fellow North Vegas residents as \"independent folk\" that have managed to carve a home out of the wasteland through hard work and grit, and he takes pride in his role of safeguarding their efforts through his work defending the Square against outside threats.",
    "Jules will have unique dialogue when asked about trouble with the Fiends if the player character previously entered Vault 3 and killed Motor-Runner, either independently or as part of Bounty Killer."
