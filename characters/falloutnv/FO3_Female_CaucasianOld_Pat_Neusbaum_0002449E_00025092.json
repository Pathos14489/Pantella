    "Pat Neusbaum is one of the inhabitants of Vault 112 and part of the Tranquility Lane virtual reality simulation, found in Fallout 3.",
    "The proud all-American wife of George Neusbaum and mother of Timmy, Pat is resident 375 of Vault 112, hooked up at lounger 37 for over 200 years. After numerous other simulations, she was finally placed by Stanislaus Braun, her tormentor, in the role of a shy housewife, fretting over her son, though unable to offer more than platitudes.",
    "Old Lady Dithers tops her list of worries, as she considers her to be crazy and a potential bad influence on Timmy. However, rather than confront her directly, she wants her husband to break up any potential contact between the two.",
    "Her vitals in 2277 are 82 bpm, 121/80 mmHG, 36.6°C or 97.9°F, with 19 breaths per minute and nominal stress levels: Perfectly normal for a woman her age."
