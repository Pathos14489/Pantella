    "Fisto (Fully Integrated Security Technetronic Officer) is a reprogrammable Protectron in Cerulean Robotics in Freeside in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The Fully Integrated Security Technetronic Officer, It was created by Cerulean Robotics prior to the Great War, and is the only intact, albeit incomplete, robot within its facility as of late 2281.",

    "After the snake oil salesman's arrival at New Vegas, he is seen sitting with Fisto at an abandoned taco stand for a dinner date. The salesman makes overtures towards the robot, implying that he has previously had romantic encounters with the robot, and apologizes for \"filling the void\" (via bestiality) while he was away. Fisto's only response is to report for duty. Any further advances towards Fisto by the salesman are halted by Hank MacLean, who knocks out the salesman and takes him away for use as a human test subject.",
