    "Machete is a junior law enforcer in Canterbury Commons in 2277.",
    "She used to fiercely defend Little Lamplight. At the age of 7, she slaughtered a mole rat in the caves with a machete, thus earning her nickname. She has been a bona fide celebrity ever since.",
    "At the age of 16, she was supposed to head to Big Town, but she became lost due to a dust storm and arrived at Canterbury Commons instead. Because of her pride, she refuses to admit she went to the wrong place. Dominic D'Ellsadro felt she had the potential to work as a guard, and after a year of his guidance, she has earned some respect among the residents. She works alongside Dominic as his junior law enforcer. They both keep Canterbury Commons safe from raiders, unwanted creatures, and danger in general.",
    "Machete patrols Canterbury Commons from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, eats until 1:00 PM, patrols until 6:00 PM, eats until 7:00 PM, then patrols again until 2:00 AM, after which she goes to bed and wakes up at 8:00 AM."
