    "Old Lady Gibson is a trader and the owner of the eponymous Gibson scrap yard near the town of Novac in the Mojave Wasteland in 2281. She appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Old Lady Gibson has been a lifelong scavenger, trader, and repairwoman.",
    "After eventually meeting the man who became her husband, they settled down together and claimed an old scrapyard close to the roadside town of Novac in the Mojave Wasteland.",
    "Following her husband's eventual death, the senior-citizen scavenger slowed her salvage activities while continuing to make a living with offering repair services and selling the collected scrap from her lifelong collection to interested travelers. She eventually picked up a new hobby in the form of raising and caring for dogs who lived with her.",
    "Old Lady Gibson appears in Fallout: New Vegas."
