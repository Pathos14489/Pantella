  "descriptions": [
    "Samuel Cooke is an anarchist revolutionary and former inmate of the NCR Correctional Facility in the Mojave Wasteland until he masterminded a mass breakout in 2281 that led to the shutdown of Interstate 15 and the creation of the highwaymen gang known as the Powder Gangers; Cooke himself left the prison and took his own independent gang to shelter in Vault 19 and continue planning his retaliation against the New California Republic. He appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A standout even among his fellow convicts within the NCR's justice system, Samuel Cooke's hatred of the republic is primarily motivated by political ideology, rather than just the general feeling of animosity that most common criminals usual hold towards the established authorities within the region; the 23rd-century revolutionary sees it as having become a corrupt, tyrannical beast that wantonly conquers and annexes territory, often without consent of those within that governed area, while forcing its imposed rules, laws and other regulations like its high taxes onto the wasteland regardless of whether it is accepted by the inhabitants or not.",
    "Cooke's prison sentence landed him a spot in the \"work-release\" program run out of the NCR Correctional Facility in the Mojave Wasteland. There, he labored under armed supervision repairing railways and using dynamite to blast rock obstructions for the Republic's supply chains to support their war against Caesar's Legion. Despite the harshness of his new circumstances, incarceration in frontier territory did nothing to extinguish the blazing fire in Cooke's heart fueled by revenge against the NCR.",
    "While acting the model prisoner, vocal anti-NCR sentiments aside,",
    "Eventually, sometime around October 2281, the convicts saw an opportunity. Due to NCR military command drawing away more and more of the facility's staff to the Hoover Dam garrison to defend against Legion aggression, there were fewer guards to supervise them despite requests and pleas from the warden.",
    "Despite his role as the mastermind and driving force of the breakout, Cooke did not stick around and left the prison behind together with his group of followers, allowing for Eddie to take control of the Correctional Facility and form the highwaymen gang known as the Powder Gangers.",
    "After abandoning the prison, Cooke brought his men north, looking for a defensible base of operations to resume his scheming against the republic. With the knowledge of its location that he acquired at some point, Cooke installed his group within the abandoned walls of Vault 19 below a parking lot close to Bonnie Springs,",
    "However, against his lofty goals, Cooke has faced mounting insubordination from Lem, who has begun to rethink the choice to leave a well-rationed prison sentence for meager pickings in an old Vault. He spread his skepticism among the other escapees, raising ideas of going back and surrendering to the NCR; Cooke has so far managed to keep them in the Vault,",
    "The character's name is a reference to the real-life 1960s singer-songwriter Samuel \"Sam\" Cooke; one of his most famous songs, \"Chain Gang,\" documents the harsh life of prison labor.",
    "Playstation 3 Xbox 360 The convicts and Cooke may be hostile if the player has a Vilified reputation with the Powder Gangers, or if the player killed Papa Khan."
