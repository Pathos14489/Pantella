    "Hannibal Hamlin is the leader of the Temple of the Union in the year 2277. An escaped slave from Paradise Falls, he dreams of creating a safe haven for runaway slaves in the Lincoln Memorial.",
    "Ever since he was 14 years old, he was a slave. However, six years ago, he managed to escape from his master who has been hunting him since. He now leads runaway slaves, hoping to settle safely at the Lincoln Memorial. At the Temple of the Union, he lives alongside Caleb Smith, Bill Seward, Simone Cameron, Alejandra Torres and a dog named Four Score.",
    "He attempts to collect as many artifacts relating to Abraham Lincoln as possible, referring to him as the Great Emancipator.",
    "Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.",
    "Hannibal Hamlin appears in Fallout 3, Fallout Shelter Online and is mentioned in Fallout Shelter."
