    "Sonora Cruz is the leader of the Regulators in the Capital Wasteland in 2277. She can be found at the Regulator HQ, usually standing in a dark corner of the single upstairs room.",
    "Sonora serves as the leader of the Regulators, an organization that seeks to dispense justice and maintain peace where possible.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer has joined her organization, she will act as their employer, accepting the fingers they have collected from the unjust and paying them for their altruistic deeds.",
    "Sonora has little time for practical jokes, and will rebuke the Lone Wanderer if they tell her that they have fingers to collect the bounty on without actually having any, remarking that \"justice is serious business\" and that they should make their jokes \"only when the Wastes are rid of the filth that feed off of it.\"",
    "Sonora is equipped with a unique 10mm pistol (ID 6f210) which does 100 damage per shot. It is only obtainable through console commands, as she always flees from combat, so she never actually uses it.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 A common bug found on all versions results from the AI package of Sonora Cruz. Many hostile creatures will spawn around the Regulator HQ including deathclaws, radscorpions, sentry bots, and possibly a large squad of Enclave soldiers, prompting Cruz to enter flee mode. If encountered out in the wasteland, she will still talk as if she is within the Regulator HQ. A solution if Sonora is missing is to enter the Regulator HQ and then bring up the console. Type \"prid 0006f212\" which will target Sonora, then type \"moveto player\" which will bring Sonora directly to the player character's location. Another fix that usually works is to kill all enemies outside the Regulator HQ before entering."
