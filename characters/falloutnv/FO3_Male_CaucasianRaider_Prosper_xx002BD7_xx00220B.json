    "Prosper is a slave located in the Capital Wasteland at the train tunnel in 2277.",
    "Before his capture by slavers, Prosper was a smuggler who transported illicit cargos of steel ingots from The Pitt to outlying areas. Despite his paranoia, nervousness, and carefulness, Prosper’s operation was compromised at some point prior to the Lone Wanderer meeting him. The majority of his crew were killed, while the others, including him, were sold to slavers traveling to Paradise Falls.",
    "Prosper appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer asks Prosper for the clothes off his own back, the dialogue option reads, \"I need your clothes. Give them to me. Now.\" This is a reference to a recurring line in The Terminator movie series."
