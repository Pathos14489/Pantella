    "Apprentice Melissa Watkins is a member of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, residing within the Hidden Valley bunker in the Mojave Wasteland. She appears in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A legacy member of the Brotherhood, Melissa was born to veteran members of the Mojave chapter, with her father being a scribe and her mother a paladin. After their deaths at HELIOS One during the attack by the New California Republic during Operation: Sunburst, the young Melissa was raised by the surviving chapter members.",
    "Sometime prior to 2281, Watkins convinced one of the chapter initiates, Stanton to sneak out of the bunker during the lockdown, lying about it being a \"training exercise\" and getting him to requisition a laser pistol from Knight Torres' armory stock to go hunting for bark scorpions at the nearby scorpion gulch. Initial success quickly gave way to danger once the larger, stronger radscorpions began swarming, forcing the two to retreat and causing Stanton to lose his pistol in the process; while the initiate regrets ever following Watkins' lead, the apprentice herself is completely remorseless and considered it one of the few times she has had fun in the Brotherhood."
