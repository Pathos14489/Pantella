    "James Hargrave is a young inhabitant of Rivet City in 2277.",
    "James Hargrave is one of Rivet City's few children. His father is deceased, having died while in the wasteland, specifically Andale.",
    "James is alternately sullen and wild and will do just about anything on a dare. He is capable of holding a grudge for months. He is loyal to his only friend C.J. who he picks on mercilessly. C.J. tolerates the abuse as there are no other children in the city.",
    "James' familial relationship is a sore spot (particularly should his mother also become deceased for whatever reason),",
    "James is the son of Tammy Hargrave, an emotionally abusive alcoholic who wouldn't mind selling him into slavery, and a father who died in the wasteland. His only friend, as there are no other children in the city, is C.J. Young. He and C.J. spend their time playing in the storage room or hanging around on the flight deck. He has developed a reputation similar to his mother, and a similar resentment towards her.",
    "The RunawaysLight-Fingers Hargrave",
    "PC Playstation 3 James runs away but can never be found; this is often accompanied by him also leaving C.J. behind, who continues running around Rivet City but with the player unable to interact with her in any way."
