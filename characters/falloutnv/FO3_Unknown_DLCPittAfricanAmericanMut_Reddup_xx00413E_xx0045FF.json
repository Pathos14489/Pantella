    "Reddup is a Pitt raider in the Pitt in 2277.",
    "Reddup is a former slave who fought his way up through the arena. He is one of only three known individuals to have achieved this; the others being Gruber and Squill.",
    "The Lone Wanderer’s interaction with Mex upon first arriving in The Pitt shapes their interactions with Reddup as well. Should the Lone Wanderer kill Mex and his group, Reddup and his group will ambush them upon entering Downtown, only sparing them at Ashur’s order despite his own desire to kill them. If the Lone Wanderer has disguised themselves as a slave, Mex will send them in normally, and Reddup’s group will not appear.",
    "The Lone Wanderer will gain another chance to interact with Reddup upon gaining their freedom by fighting in the arena. If he had not previously interacted with them, Reddup will be dismissive of them and tell them to watch their step, to which the Lone Wanderer can reply with comments of their own.",
    "Reddup appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "Reddup shares his name with a Western Pennsylvania expression, \"redd up\", meaning \"tidy up\" or \"clean up\"."
