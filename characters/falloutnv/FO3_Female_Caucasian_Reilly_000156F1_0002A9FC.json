    "Reilly is a member as well as the leader and founder of the mercenary band known as Reilly's Rangers encountered in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3.",
    "The young Reilly grew up without her parents in the ruins of the former American capital Washington, D.C., instead being raised by an unnamed man with a military background who brought her up to be self-sufficient. Her adoptive parent died around 12 years later, with Reilly carrying his body to Arlington Cemetery for a proper military burial. Four years prior to 2277, at the age of 26, she founded a group dedicated to eradicating the threat of super mutants and geomapping the Capital Wasteland, naming them Reilly's Rangers.",
    "Sometime shortly before the Lone Wanderer left Vault 101 in 2277, Reilly and the Rangers traveled to Vernon Square to map out the ruins, where they were ambushed by the infesting super mutants and eventually overpowered, forced to take shelter in the Statesman Hotel. Reilly herself attempted to escape solo to find help getting her group out of danger but ended up seriously wounded. She managed to evade the mutants' attacks, making it as far as the Museum of History where she was found by passing scavengers and brought to Doctor Barrows at the Chop Shop within Underworld, drifting in and out of consciousness.",
