    "Joshua Graham, also known as the Burned Man and formerly known as the Malpais Legate, is a Mormon missionary from the settlement of New Canaan and a co-founder of Caesar's Legion as well as its first legate. After three decades of service in the Legion, helping Caesar carry out his conquest of the former state of Arizona and much of the former American Southwest, Graham's strategic loss in 2277 to the New California Republic at the First Battle of Hoover Dam resulted in Caesar punishing him by being set on fire and thrown into the Grand Canyon, only to survive. When Caesar retaliated by sending the White Legs raiders to raze New Canaan and chase the survivors into Zion Canyon in 2281, Graham rallied the Dead Horses tribe as their war-chief to protect Zion and atone for his bloodstained past.",
    "He appears as the central character in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Honest Hearts and is mentioned in Fallout: New Vegas and its add-on Lonesome Road.",
    "Born in New Canaan, a Mormon community established in what remained of the city of Ogden, Utah, Joshua Graham grew up in peaceful times, learning the trade of a missionary and an interpreter due to his natural aptitude for languages. In 2246, Graham received the call to partake in his sacred service to spread the good word to the people of the wasteland. By the time he left his home, he was already fluent in several tribal dialects. His aptitude for linguistics made him a natural choice when the Followers of the Apocalypse asked for assistance in their expedition to the Grand Canyon. Graham departed New Canaan, following the Long 15 and US Route 89 south towards Arizona to meet two Followers, Bill Calhoun and Edward Sallow on the way, joining their expedition to provide assistance to the local tribes residing in and around the Grand Canyon, and to make a study of their dialects, with Graham providing translations between both groups.",
    "Around 2247, the Blackfoot tribe were their first stop in the Grand Canyon. Though Joshua proved to be a capable interpreter, the hospitality of their hosts was abruptly replaced with hostility. Whether it was an error in translation that Joshua made, or some unrelated misunderstanding, the Blackfoots switched to holding the entire expedition for ransom.",
    "The Legate rallies his legionaries",
    "With his teachings and Graham's skills, the Blackfoots prevailed over the other tribes and hailed Sallow as their leader. Graham became a field commander, training the forces of the fledgling army and leading them in battle. His leadership position soon entailed retaliatory raids and terrorizing local tribes. When Sallow cast off his old name and crowned himself Caesar, lord of the Legion, Graham became the first legate, the 'Malpais Legate'. For thirty years he helped Caesar conquer the tribes residing in the former American Southwest, taking over large swaths of the former states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, strengthening the Legion with every tribe assimilated. Though Graham admits that he was neither a particularly brilliant strategist nor tactically flexible, his menace and brutality as the Malpais Legate were infamous. The atrocities he committed under Caesar's banner made him feared by friend and foe alike. A dangerous, unpredictable, destructive force above all else, Graham was legendary for being impossible to kill, surviving multiple assassination attempts by First Recon sharpshooters and NCR Rangers.",
    "Despite his infamous reputation, there comes an end to everything eventually. For the Malpais Legate, his end came at the First Battle of Hoover Dam.",
    "Left to carry the shame of his failure at Hoover Dam, the Malpais Legate returned to Caesar back east. But the Son of Mars' anger would not accept the Legion's loss in battle. To demonstrate to the remainder of his army that failure would not be tolerated, even from the highest ranks, Caesar brought Graham back to the Grand Canyon. Caesar ordered his Praetorian Guard to cover the legate in pitch, set him on fire and throw him from the cliff's edge, to be left for dead in the canyon below.",
    "The birth of the Burned Man",
    "Despite the clear lethality that such a punishment carried, Graham's legendary toughness allowed him to survive the descent. Waking up the following day, burned and broken, but alive, the fallen legate realized he had nowhere to go but home, back to New Canaan. Under the extreme pain of his injuries, Graham crawled out of the northern edge of the Grand Canyon and began the long trek back. After his fiery descent, Graham's attempts to dull the pain of his burns led him to discover he possessed a natural immunity to wasteland drugs, both positive and negative, leaving him with only replacing the bandages covering his charred skin each day to prevent infection; the process forces him to expose his flesh to the air and he comments that it feels like being burned alive all over again.",
    "Meanwhile, the terror of the Malpais Legate and the story of his blazing fall into the Grand Canyon coalesced into legends of the fearsome \"Burned Man\" stalking the wastelands, spreading among the remaining tribes until eventually reaching the ears of Caesar. Realizing that his attempt to punish Graham had failed, Caesar forbade his legionaries from speaking Graham's true name under threat of death (the practice of Damnatio memoriae), but this only served to enhance the menace of the Burned Man.",
    "For his part, Graham decided to forgive Caesar's actions in their shared history, in keeping with his religious belief that one must hate the sin, but love the sinner.",
    "Joshua Graham making his way to New Canaan after killing several assassins of Caesar's Legion",
    "By 2281, Graham's bloodstained past finally caught up with him. The White Legs, whipped into a frenzy and equipped by Ulysses on Caesar's orders, staged an attack on New Canaan while Joshua and most of the capable Canaanites was away from the city, in a bid to ingratiate themselves with the Legion by destroying Graham's family tribe, and Graham, along with them. Most of the Mormon tribe was slaughtered and the survivors scattered into the wilderness, with the bulk of them seeking refuge in Zion Canyon. In order to defend them and the tribes that made their home in the canyon, Graham assumed the position of acting war chief among the Dead Horses, a tribe he had interacted with during his time with the Legion, alongside Daniel, another missionary and survivor from New Canaan, who joined up with the Sorrows.",
    "When the White Legs pursued them into Zion, Daniel and Graham found themselves in a conflict with each other: while Daniel would rather use peaceful delaying action to allow the Sorrows and Dead Horses to safely evacuate Zion and lose the White Legs in the wilderness, Joshua desired nothing more than to bring God's justice to those who would bring senseless harm to others, and wipe the White Legs from the face of the earth. The impulse to exact vengeance on those who butchered his people, killing all who could not run away fast enough - the elderly, the ill, children, and even those who stopped to help - burns within him alongside his guilt for past sins and desire for true repentance.",
    "Joshua Graham inspecting .45 Auto pistols for use against the White Legs",
    "Joshua Graham is at heart a conflicted man. Originally a follower of the Mormon faith, he steadily betrayed everything he held dear in service to Caesar, helping the warlord conquer the tribes of the wasteland.",
    "Despite his former allegiance to Caesar's Legion and its brutal way of life, the Burned Man does not hold any ill will towards the NCR and its allies. To him, the NCR is still redeemable in his eyes, believing it was the greed of man that led to the Great War, and that only through faith in God and prayer and genuine acts of kindness, can humanity hope to prevent history from repeating itself. Conversely, he has a dim opinion of Mr. House, viewing the lord of New Vegas as another Caesar: a man who brought the tribes to heel and wields his power for the domination of others.",
    "His hatred towards the Legion stems not just from the act of being burned alive by Caesar, but also the combination of Caesar's belief that his will alone is enough to unite the wasteland under the Legion's banner and his refusal to let anything stop him. Ultimately, though, his greatest enmity lies in one person: Joshua Graham - for letting himself get swept up in the bloodshed that heralded Caesar's rise to power, for falling in line as his Legate, and for willfully perpetuating the innumerable atrocities that helped establish the Legion's rule in the wasteland. What he thought was the start of a community of equals under one banner had become the heinous regime of a tyrant, and it was something Joshua earnestly believed he would spend the rest of his life atoning for.",
    "Joshua Graham appears in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Honest Hearts and Fallout: Wasteland Warfare as \"The Burned Man\" unit. He is mentioned in Fallout: New Vegas and its add-ons Dead Money and Lonesome Road. He was also intended to appear in Van Buren, the canceled Fallout 3 by Black Isle Studios.",
    "It's not as simple as being \"set on fire\". After suffering a terrible failure, he was humiliated by his superior and the people he commanded. He was cast out and left for dead. His entire reason for living was gone. When your entire way of life is completely destroyed, it has a profound impact on how you view yourself and your place in the world. Because all momentum is lost, the experience causes you to evaluate and re-evaluate how you have reached this point -- and how to move forward.",
    "As much as can be expected. A lot of players really wanted to see the Hanged Man/Burned Man incarnation from the Van Buren design documents, so I think most of those people were unhappy with how he turned out.",
    "I had wanted to develop a religious conflict in an RPG for a while, one that wasn't presented as pro-religion vs. anti-religion. I didn't want to use a proxy/fictitious religion and I didn't want to use religion as the set-up for a series of jokes. My first idea for Honest Hearts was a direct conflict between Joshua and Daniel where Joshua was more like his pre-fall self, but I didn't think the characterization would be particularly interesting and I didn't think players would struggle much with the decision of whom to support. It didn't take long for me to change the main conflict to one about Joshua and Daniel vs. an external threat, with the player's choice revolving around which leader to support. I think we often present players with a choice between two bad solutions and we ask them to decide which one is least bad. With Honest Hearts, I wanted the player to decide which solution would produce the most good.",
    "I wanted the player's first encounter with Joshua to be very reductive. In way, I wanted the player to be initially disappointed. They hear legends of this fearsome, terrible, demonic figure and when they first see him, he's doing the equivalent of putting his pants on one leg at a time: sitting at a table maintaining a stack of guns. Even internally, some people complained about his appearance. They wanted him to be huge and monstrous or they wanted his first encounter with the player to involve him brutally gunning down White Legs. I believed that for his character to feel right in the context of the story, he needed to be a man first and the monster later. But that expressed desire on the team made me ask for the graffiti players see on the way to see Joshua: an entire cliff face dominated by the image of Joshua with tiny White Leg corpses falling down below him. In the image, he's like Goya's Saturn, dwarfing and destroying everyone around him.",
    "Presenting the conflict with Daniel posed some challenges because Daniel is not a living legend, i.e. he is even more of a normal man than Joshua is trying to be. Additionally, Mormonism is not a pacifistic religion (and its soteriology does not depend on pacifism), so the conflict could not reasonably by framed around violence vs. non-violence even in the post-apocalyptic version followed by the New Canaanites. Daniel's concern was about larger issues than fighting or not-fighting; he was concerned that Joshua's lapsed nature would cause a whirlwind of warfare that would pull everyone far away New Canaanite traditions to the point where religion was virtually abandoned in favor of a war cult surrounding Joshua.",
    "Subconsciously, yes, but I didn't sit down and think \"gonna make this dude a Greek tragic hero\".",
    "I think it's worth noting that in even Van Buren's documents, a lot of the references to the Hanged Man's \"evil\" refers to past acts. In VB, he was seemingly a man without purpose. While his characterization by others and his tendency to laugh off/ignore attempts by others to control him could have been interesting, it really ended at \"nasty guy who says and does creepy stuff and is a badass\". There were specific instances (such as at New Canaan) where he would specifically avoid conflict and showed some additional depth, but he effectively had no character arc within the story.",
    "Personally, I think the \"wow so crazy\" type characters aren't particularly interesting or insightful because they only exist in pure fantasy and, as such, can't really be related to. I think it's important for characters who are influencing player opinions to be more-or-less human. If you can't put yourself in the character's shoes, it's hard to empathize with him or her.",
