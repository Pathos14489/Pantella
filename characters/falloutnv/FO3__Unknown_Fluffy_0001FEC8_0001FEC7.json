  "description": "Fluffy is a 1 year-old N/A Unknown.\n\nA large radroach kept as a pet by Jitters in the Sniper Shack. Its chitinous shell glistens unnaturally in the dim light, suggesting it may have been exposed to radiation or other mutagens.\n\nFluffy's Personality: Skittish yet curious, Fluffy spends most of its time scurrying around its cage, occasionally attempting to climb the bars. It seems to recognize its owner Jitters and becomes more active when he is near, though it remains wary of strangers.\n\nFluffy's Backstory: Fluffy was likely born in the irradiated ruins of the Capitol Wasteland and was captured by Jitters, the reclusive sniper who occupies the Sniper Shack. Jitters seems to have taken a strange liking to the creature, keeping it as a companion in his otherwise solitary existence. Fluffy's unusual size and appearance suggest it may have been exposed to significant radiation or other environmental factors that caused accelerated growth."
