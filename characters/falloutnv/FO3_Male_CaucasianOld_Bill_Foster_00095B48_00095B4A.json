    "William \"Bill\" Foster is one of the inhabitants of Vault 112 trapped within the Tranquility Lane virtual reality simulation in Fallout 3. He does not have a home at the Lane, apparently the only adult without one.",
    "Resident 906 of Vault 112, William Foster has been given the role of the local kindly elder engineer,",
    "Foster is on good terms with everyone at the Lane, keeping his nose out of other people's business and giving a helpful hand to everyone in need. Mabel Henderson, the local gossip, tops this list, as she's very fond of her gadgets and her Mister Handy robot is very maintenance intensive. Foster blames it on her reluctance to order replacement parts.",
    "By 2277, Foster's vitals indicate a state of  contentment: 72 beats per minute, 115/80 mmHg of blood pressure, 98.4°F/36.85°C temperature, 19 breaths per minute, and nominal stress levels."
