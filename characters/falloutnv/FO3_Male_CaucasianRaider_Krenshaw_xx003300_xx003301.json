    "Krenshaw is Ashur's second-in-command of the Pitt in 2277.",
    "After the betrayal and departure of Wernher, Krenshaw became Ashur’s second-in-command.",
    "When the Lone Wanderer gains their freedom by successfully winning a set of fights in the arena, Krenshaw congratulates them on their accomplishments and relays that Ashur wishes to see them, also providing them with \"gifts\" from him, those being their previously confiscated items.",
    "Krenshaw has growing concerns that the slaves plan to revolt and is also worried that the auto axes they manufactured will be used in their plan to overthrow the Pitt raiders. When the Lone Wanderer first arrives in Haven, Krenshaw and Ashur are seen debating the issue, during which Krenshaw becomes frustrated at Ashur's lack of concern over it. However, he ultimately wins Ashur over, and the two construct a plan with which to address the situation, with Ashur advising Krenshaw to put his guards on alert and keep an eye on Midea, as any important occurrences would be sure to go through her.",
    "Krenshaw appears only in the add-on The Pitt for Fallout 3."
