    "Aurelius of Phoenix is a centurion of Caesar's Legion, acting as the commanding officer of the Legion garrison at Cottonwood Cove in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A man of great stature, standing at 6'7\" (2.01 m),",
    "Aurelius takes pride in his standing as a centurion, but does not take kindly to those he believes are unworthy of superior positions",
    "Despite his incredible ego and cruel streak against NCR soldiers, Aurelius does seem to have a softer side, with a toy car, a teddy bear and a Grognak the Barbarian comic in his office. There is also beer and cigarettes there, and the question of whether it is his personal stash or confiscated contraband remains open.",
