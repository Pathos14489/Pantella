  "description": "Quinn is a 175 year-old Ghoul Male.\n\nA weathered ghoul trader with a lifetime of experience navigating the dangers of the wasteland. His battle-worn appearance and cautious demeanor speak to a long life spent in the harsh post-apocalyptic world. Despite his preference for solitude, Quinn possesses a keen insight into human nature and the ever-changing landscape of the wasteland.\n\nQuinn's Personality: Introverted, cautious, and observant. Quinn values his solitude but is not entirely antisocial, showing selective trust based on his keen judgment of character. He is knowledgeable about the wasteland's happenings, particularly around the Mall, and shares this information selectively.\n\nQuinn's Backstory: Born in the early years of the 22nd century, Quinn witnessed the Great War as a child. He survived the initial devastation but was exposed to significant radiation, transforming him into a ghoul. Over the decades, he honed his skills as a trader and information broker, learning to navigate the treacherous wasteland and its various factions. Quinn eventually found a home in the Underworld, a ghoul-friendly settlement beneath the ruins of a D.C. metro station. There, he established himself as a reliable source of goods and information, particularly about the Mall area. Despite the prejudice ghouls often face, Quinn's good karma and fair dealings have earned him respect among both ghouls and humans who frequent the Underworld."
