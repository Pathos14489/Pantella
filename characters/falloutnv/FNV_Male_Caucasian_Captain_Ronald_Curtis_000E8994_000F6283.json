    "Picus is a frumentarius of Caesar's Legion using the identity of Captain Ronald Curtis to infiltrate the New California Republic Army in Fallout: New Vegas. As \"Captain Ronald Curtis\", he is an officer of the NCR, leading Bravo Company at Camp McCarran.",
    "Officially an upstanding officer of the NCR Army, Ronald Curtis has enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks, reaching the rank of captain and position of Bravo Company commander in three and a half years (six months faster than usual).",
    "This was not by accident: \"Curtis\" is actually a frumentarius named Picus sent by Caesar years before the Legion arrived on the banks of the Colorado River to challenge the NCR.",
    "Normally, Curtis would be commanding Bravo Company in the field. However, General Lee Oliver placed his company at Camp McCarran to shore up its defenses. While Bravo Company mans the walls as forward sentries, Curtis coordinates the management of the NCR's forces with Colonel James Hsu, granting him full access to patrol schedules, supply lines, and reinforcement logistics that he dictates himself.",
    "The Legion's frumentarii have been planning this operation for years as a part of the greater plan, named Racket, first requiring one of theirs, Picus, to infiltrate the NCR. The NCR bolsters its presence in New Vegas from Camp McCarran; using the connecting monorail lets them occupy two positions for the price of one. In his years at McCarran, Picus has learned all he can about this monorail and its status as a crucial part of the NCR's effectiveness.",
    "However, by 2281, Picus came to believe that Hsu had begun to suspect him, forcing him to look for a scapegoat on which to pin the monorail's impending sabotage. He'd even planned to completely disappear after the event, in case the NCR did eventually discover his identity. Picus acquired bomb-making supplies with the intent to plant them in Private Davey Crenshaw's personal footlocker, exploiting the soldier's notoriety as a practical joker to ward off Hsu's suspicions, though it additionally would require his death to prevent any potential leak of the truth. When the Courier first arrives at Camp McCarran, the culmination of Picus' years-long efforts to sabotage Caesar's enemies hangs on the edge, waiting for just the right co-conspirator, willing or otherwise to succeed.",
    "Silus, a centurion captured alive in 2281, recognized Curtis upon being brought into McCarran, having seen him years earlier during the latter's frumentarii training. He did not know his alias, however.",
