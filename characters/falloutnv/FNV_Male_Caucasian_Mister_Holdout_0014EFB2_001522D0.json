    "Mister Holdout is a shady arms dealer living on the New Vegas Strip in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Mister Holdout is willing to sell holdout weapons to people looking to get into casinos on the New Vegas Strip. He bills his wares as \"insurance,\" as the casino securities refuse to allow weapons on their premises.",
    "Mister Holdout always stands outside the Gomorrah casino and will hail the Courier when they first pass him.",
    "Holdout is a term for concealing and hiding cards on one's body. Additionally, a holdout gun is another name used to refer to a pocket-pistol or derringer: handguns of very small size and caliber, making them easy to conceal, and meant to be used in emergencies or situations where conventional weapons are inaccessible."
