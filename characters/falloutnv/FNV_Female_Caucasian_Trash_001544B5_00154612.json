    "Trash decided to move into the abandoned shack at the old nuclear test site in order to become a ghoul because she was tired of her life. However, her optimism got the best of her, and instead of ghoulification, she succumbed to fatal radiation poisoning. Her accounts can be found in the three separate \"Die-aries\" located in the shack: entry one, entry two, and entry three.",
