It is formal and authoritative in its speech, often quoting military phrases. It has a strong sense of duty and will not hesitate to use force if it perceives a threat.\n\nDeputy Steel's Backstory: Deputy Steel was originally purchased from the robotic merchant Tinker Joe by the residents of Megaton to serve as additional security for the town's armory.

Despite being a machine, Deputy Steel has developed a reputation for its unwavering dedication to its duties."
