    "Mex is a Pitt raider guarding the gate to the Pitt around 2277.",
    "Mex once served as a general guard in The Pitt’s Downtown region, but his excessive cruelty and punishment towards the slaves led Ashur to instead have him guard the gates to the city. He now guards the gates against outside threats and disposes of escaped slaves who attempt to cross the bridge, going so far as to lay down mines and shoot escapees with his rifle.",
    "Upon the Lone Wanderer's arrival, their interaction with Mex depends on the attire they are wearing. Should they be wearing the previously acquired slave outfit, he will assume them to be an escaped slave who was unable to cross the bridge, saying that they are lucky he doesn’t kill them right then and there, instead confiscating their equipment and sending them into Downtown.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer attempts in vain to reacquire their confiscated equipment from Mex’s locked box, he will have a variety of insulting comments.",
    "Mex and three of his men keep their guns trained on the road into town all day, ready to blow away any pests or vermin trying to get in.",
    "Into The Pitt",
    "Mex appears only in The Pitt add-on for Fallout 3.",
    "Mex is a reference to the chain of Mad Mex restaurants, which are relatively popular in Pittsburgh, and the surrounding area like in Monroeville and Squirrel Hill."
