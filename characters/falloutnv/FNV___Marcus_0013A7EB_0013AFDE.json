  "descriptions": [
    "Marcus is an elderly Mariposa super mutant serving as the sheriff of Broken Hills in 2241 and mayor of Jacobstown in 2281.",
    "One of the surviving original members of the mutant-supremacist Unity, his once fervent dedication to the Master's cause has since softened into a more tolerant attitude, paired with a desire for a world where mutants and humans coexist in peace. A strong leader through the decades, Marcus has played an integral role in the founding of the towns of Broken Hills in New California, and Black Mountain and Jacobstown in the Mojave Wasteland. He appears as a possible companion of the Chosen One in Fallout 2 and a minor character in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A burly old mutant with a weary cast to his face, Marcus' toughness and vigor",
    "Since his \"rebirth\", Marcus served in the Master's Unity with distinction, a firm believer in his vision and philosophy. For Marcus, the Master's plan was a chance to elevate humankind above internecine conflict, to break out of the vicious cycle of war. Marcus believed that humans could never elevate themselves alone, that the Master's actions were a necessary step in the advancement of humanity.",
    "Marcus' faith and direction in life, like most of his fellow super mutants' was shaken to the core after the destruction of the Cathedral and death of the Master at the hands of the Vault Dweller in 2161. Due to being the one that killed the Master's dream of elevating humanity, the Vault Dweller was initially an object of his hatred, though with time, as his attitude towards humans softened, Marcus also came to develop a healthy respect for the hero. As he saw it, if all humans fought for their beliefs with such conviction as the Vault Dweller did, a force like the Master would not have been needed to change the natural order. Still, he missed his friends in the Unity, remembering them as the best that humanity had to offer.",
    "Left without a guiding voice to give him purpose after the Master's death, Marcus took to wandering the wastes. Around 2185, his path crossed that of Jacob, a journeyman knight of the Brotherhood of Steel. Seeing the other as an enemy, the two fought on and on for a few days non-stop until, worn out and left in a moment of calm, they realized the futility of the fight. As the pair laughed together, Jacob declared he was abandoning his sworn oath to destroy mutants and obliged to join Marcus in his travels.",
    "As they traveled New California together, sharing many discussions over topics such as Brotherhood doctrine and the tenets of the Unity (in particular, the neurolink between the Master and the Cathedral's computers), other wastelanders gradually flocked to, and began following them; after all, it doesn't get any safer than a Brotherhood knight and a super mutant veteran. Realizing the opportunity they had, Marcus led the growing group to the site of a pre-War uranium mining town that he knew about from old maps. There, he and Jacob founded the settlement of Broken Hills in the fall of 2185.",
    "In his capacity as sheriff and mayor, Marcus' steady hand in managing the affairs of the town led it to prosperity. The uranium from the mine found its way to numerous clients in the wastelands, including Vault City.",
    "By the 23rd century, around 2241, rumors circulated of an anti-mutant conspiracy, doing little to help quell the growing strife within Broken Hills. As he had only been chasing shadows until then, Marcus, in an act of desperation, extended a request for help to a tribal wanderer that came to his town in 2241, the Chosen One. After his new ally successfully exposed the conspiracy and neutralized the conspirators, in the process saving Broken Hills' mine from closure, the mutant warrior decided he was far too old for settling down and offered his help as a companion of the tribal. Among the deeds done by Marcus in his time traveling with the Chosen One, the greatest was helping his friend assault Control Station Enclave, saving the people of Arroyo and ending the threat of the Enclave by vaporizing the oil rig in nuclear fire.",
    "After his adventures with the Chosen One, Marcus never returned to Broken Hills, as the dried-up uranium mine meant there was little reason for anyone to inhabit the place anymore. Instead, he wandered again, this time heading east into the Rocky Mountains, fueled by the inspiration of a dear friend once again. Now with a goal in mind, Marcus trekked to find other mutants like himself scattered around the wastes and create another place they could call home.",
    "On his new march through the wasteland, Marcus' talent as a charismatic leader worked well, gathering a sizable following of super mutants to him. Eventually, he and his followers crossed into the Mojave Wasteland where they reached Black Mountain, a pre-War military comms array that had been left highly irradiated from a direct nuclear strike during the Great War. Most human scavengers avoided the place due to its lethal radiation, however, this did not deter the mutants, who claimed Black Mountain as their new home in 2277. Closer inspection of the old array revealed the machines, in particular the radio equipment was in serviceable condition, enhancing its appeal as Marcus hoped to use it to reach out with his messages of a mutant haven.",
    "However, despite his good intentions, Black Mountain did not turn out to be the safe haven Marcus imagined it as. The most severe roadblock to his ideals came when an exodus of nightkin arrived at Black Mountain, led by Tabitha, a former high-ranking member of the Unity and a nightkin herself who suffered from a particularly severe case of Stealth Boy-induced schizophrenia, of which was exacerbated after Rhonda, her robot companion broke down and none of the mutants could repair it. Marcus' attempts to distract her with a journal project failed when she discovered Black Mountain's functional radio station and managed to get it repaired.",
    "Against Marcus' attempts for peace, the situation at Black Mountain was coming undone at the seams. As Tabitha's nightkin began to regularly clash with Marcus' fellow first generation super mutants, rather than aggravate the conflict, he chose to leave along with those mutants loyal to him in 2279, seeking somewhere else to establish their peaceful community, though not before Marcus personally smashed the radio transmitter in an attempt to hamper Tabitha's efforts.",
    "After the disastrous events at Black Mountain, Marcus and his remaining followers traveled further away from the human-settled areas like New Vegas, eventually coming to find an old ski lodge nestled against the cliffs of Mount Charleston to the northwest. In honor of his old, old friend, Marcus declared their new home as Jacobstown. The town's isolation from human settlements allowed for the mutant inhabitants' lives to remain largely peaceful and left with enough space to house their giant frames and a wealthy crop to sustain them; the only regular trouble they faced was harassment by local packs of night stalkers attacking their bighorner cattle. Marcus' ultimate goal for Jacobstown was to establish it as a valuable trading partner to human organizations and an example of human-mutant cooperation, in essence a second, longer-lasting Broken Hills.",
    "Sometime prior to 2281, Marcus granted permission to Doctor Henry to take up residence in the old lodge in exchange for the doctor putting his scientific expertise to use developing a cure for the epidemic of schizophrenia among the nightkin. Word of Marcus' efforts to develop a cure attracted influential leaders among the disparate nightkin groups such as Keene and Davison, and they and their followers flocked to the town. However, as the research efforts dragged on, their patience for what was increasingly appearing to be an empty promise began to drain away.",
    "He is skilled with big guns and large energy weapons. However, sometimes his use of burst weapons are as devastating to the team as to enemies. Also, like all other super mutants (barring those in Fallout Tactics), he is incapable of wearing armor which leaves him somewhat vulnerable. However, Marcus does have innate armor statistics that increase as he gains in abilities, thus mitigating his inability to equip armor. At his highest level, he has the equivalent of a suit of combat armor. The ammunition for his big guns can be a problem, too. This can be dealt with by arming him with a non-burst weapon like a turbo plasma rifle.",
    "Marcus can be found randomly when taking a card from the loot deck. When the player character has him as the active companion and performs a test that uses Strength, Endurance, or Intelligence, he can be exhausted to gain one hit on the test.",
    "When the player character performs the camp action, he will become unexhausted. However, if the player character does not have at least three SPECIAL tokens at this time, he must be discarded.",
    "Marcus appears as a talking head in Fallout 2, and in Fallout: New Vegas as a minor character, where he is voiced by Michael Dorn in both. Marcus appears as a companion in Fallout: The Board Game in the expansion Fallout: New California. He appears in Fallout: Wasteland Warfare as a unit in the Super Mutants faction. He is mentioned in the Fallout Bible.",
    "Marcus's voice actor, Michael Dorn, in the voiceover booth for Fallout: New Vegas",
    "\"Inspired by the example set by the Chosen One, Marcus eventually traveled across the great mountains to the east, searching for other refugees from the Master's army. You never heard from him again.\""
