    "Allen Mack is a resident of Vault 101, a fervent isolationist, and its potential overseer in Fallout 3.",
    "The head of the Mack household, Allen is a powerful presence in the Vault, and believes that it's a good life, sealed forever underground. Anyone who goes out of their way to mess it up is a sworn enemy of his.",
    "His redeeming feature is his love for his family. While strict, Allen genuinely loves and cares about his children: When his son, Wally, had his tenth birthday, he managed to coax Andy the Mr. Handy to perform magic tricks, and organized a game of Hunt the Mutant in the Vault's atrium.",
    "When James escaped from the Vault 19 years later, Allen's worst fears were confirmed. He fought against the radroach infestation, personally saving many lives,",
    "Allen Mack is the husband of Gloria Mack, and the father of Wally, Steve and Susie Mack. His father-in-law is Stanley Armstrong. He also has two sisters-in-law, Beatrice Armstrong and Mary Kendall.",
    "Allen Mack banging on the window.",
    "* Only during Trouble on the Homefront if he becomes the overseer.",
    "During the quest Escape!, it is impossible to enter the room where the Macks live (without console commands). Viewing Vault 101 in the G.E.C.K. reveals that Mack's \"room\" is just a short stretch of the corridor without an entrance. It is impossible to enter his room due to the fact that he is scripted to become the new overseer should the current one die."
