    "Doctor Preston is the physician of Rivet City in 2277.",
    "Born in 2227, Dr. Preston is a kind old man who is well-loved by Rivet City's denizens. Much of this has to do with the fact that he genuinely loves helping the injured and the sick. He takes his job in the Rivet City clinic seriously and treats his patients to the best of his ability.",
    "The doctor is a creature of habit in his personal life. He eats (and drinks) solely at the Weatherly Hotel, where Mister Buckingham knows his usual order by (mechanical) heart.",
    "Although Preston is in his fifties, he does not know much about Rivet City's history, as he hails from elsewhere.",
    "Doctor Preston wakes up at 6 a.m. and eats at the Weatherly Hotel until 8 a.m. He will spend the next 13 hours in the Rivet City clinic, only coming out once at 4 p.m. to eat dinner at the Weatherly Hotel until 6 p.m. before returning. At 10 p.m., he will leave the clinic and go to sleep in his room. On Thursdays, Doctor Preston will additionally visit Doctor Li in the Rivet City science lab from 8 to 10 p.m. for her weekly checkup; this will stop happening after she leaves the city.",
    "If the player asks the doctor to purchase chems, he will respond that he \"is a doctor, not a dealer!\" This is an allusion to the phrase \"I'm a doctor, not a ...\" spoken by the Star Trek character Leonard McCoy."
