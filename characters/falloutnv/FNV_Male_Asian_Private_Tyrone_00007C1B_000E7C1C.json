  "description": "Private Tyrone is a 29 year-old Asian Male.\n\nA disciplined NCR trooper responsible for supply deliveries between California and Primm. Tyrone has noticed irregularities in the supply chain and suspects chemical supplies are being diverted to the Great Khans.\n\nPrivate Tyrone's Personality: Disciplined and observant, Private Tyrone is loyal to the NCR but increasingly concerned about corruption within the ranks. He maintains a professional demeanor but shows signs of disillusionment.\n\nPrivate Tyrone's Backstory: Born and raised in California, Tyrone enlisted in the New California Republic army at a young age. After several years of service, he was assigned to supply duty along the California-Nevada border. Over the past few months, he's noticed that certain chemical supplies have been going missing during transit, and he's begun to suspect that higher-ups are involved in a smuggling operation that funnels these supplies to the Great Khans, who use them to produce drugs for the Fiends."
