    "Sheriff McBain was the sheriff of Primm who, along with his wife, was killed by escaped convicts in his sleep in late October, 2281.",
    "McBain was known as a brave man and a good sheriff that protected Primm. leaving the McBains' decapitated corpses behind at the sheriff's office to rot. They were only given a proper burial by the townsfolk of Primm once peace was restored.",
    "Joshua Sawyer stated that while some naked corpses in the game could be seen as indicative of \"defilement,\" the McBains in particular are examples of where the naked bodies are used to represent that they were killed in their sleep."
