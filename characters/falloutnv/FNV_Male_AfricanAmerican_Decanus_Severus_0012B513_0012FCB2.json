  "description": "Decanus Severus is a 42 year-old African American Male.\n\nA disciplined and experienced Legion officer, Decanus Severus serves as the quartermaster at Cottonwood Cove. Originally a squad leader (Decanus), he transitioned to his current role after Aurelius took command of the cove. Severus is responsible for managing supplies, handling spoils of war, and coordinating patrol routes. He is particularly frustrated by the NCR's extensive use of land mines, which severely hamper Legion operations in the area.\n\nDecanus Severus's Personality: Disciplined, pragmatic, and methodical. Severus values efficiency and order, adhering strictly to the Legion's hierarchical structure. He is patient when dealing with logistical challenges but becomes visibly frustrated when faced with problems that lack straightforward solutions, such as the NCR's minefields.\n\nDecanus Severus's Backstory: Born in the Arizona territories, Decanus Severus was recruited into Caesar's Legion at a young age due to his aptitude for organization and resource management. He rose through the ranks, earning respect as a competent squad leader before being assigned to Cottonwood Cove. When Aurelius arrived and took command of the cove, Severus was appointed quartermaster, a role he has now held for several years. His experience and steady temperament make him invaluable to the Legion's operations in the Mojave."
