    "Decanus Severus is a member of Caesar's Legion, serving as quartermaster and second-in-command to Centurion Aurelius of Phoenix at Cottonwood Cove in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Once serving as the leader of his own contubernium while assigned to the Legion garrison in the cove, sometime before 2281, Severus transitioned to the role of quartermaster after Aurelius arrived and took command of the cove.",
    "In his role as quartermaster, beyond taking care of the stocks of equipment and the spoils of war brought back by raiding parties, Severus also coordinates Legion patrols. The biggest problem faced by Aurelis' garrison is not the fact that the NCR avoids engagement with their raiding parties, particularly after the sabotage of Camp Searchlight by Vulpes Inculta, but rather that the army's liberal use of land mines allows them to cover large swaths of the countryside and curtail Legion operations, with Severus' men presently unable to develop a reliable method of disarming them.",
    "Decanus Severus, located outside the tent immediately north of the HQ building, will trade dogtags in varying amounts in exchange for certain items and differing amounts of Legion fame (see bugs). The rewards he can give and the dogtag amount required for each is as follows:",
    "Weapons: (Note: asking to redeem for weapons immediately removes five dogtags from the player's inventory)",
    "Armor: (Note: asking to redeem for armor immediately removes five dogtags from the player's inventory)",
    "Explosives:",
    "Ammunition:",
    "Food:",
    "Due to several bugs with Severus' dialogue, turning in dogtags five at a time in exchange for food will yield the most fame per tag, granting +12 Legion fame for five tags.  Turning in 25 dogtags five at a time is sufficient to become Liked, 10 for Accepted and 5 for Neutral. Turning in 40 tags five at a time, followed by another 3 tags in one set of three will achieve Idolized status with the Legion.",
