Twigbag trusts no one and is always looking for ways to advance his own interests, often at the expense of others.\n\nTwigbag's Backstory: Born in the Capital Wasteland, Twigbag turned to a life of crime at a young age. He eventually made his way to Point Lookout, where he established himself as a key player in the local smuggling operations. He deals in everything from weapons and chems to slaves, always ensuring he gets the better end of any deal. Twigbag has made many enemies over the years, but his knowledge of the swamp and his willingness to use violence have kept him alive."
