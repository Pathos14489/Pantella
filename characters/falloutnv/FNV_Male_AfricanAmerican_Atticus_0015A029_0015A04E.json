    "He visits the safehouse to resupply every three days and offers the Courier various items such as two Stealth Boys, two Cateye, or two random skill magazines.",
    "A Trusted Aide",
    "Another NPC named Atticus is found in the game's files. He too is a member of Caesar's Legion veteran faction and offers similar dialogue options such as giving the player character various items. This version, however, was set to appear in The Fort.",
    "Playstation 3 When updating the game into a newer version, and then creating a new game, Atticus or any other safehouse keepers will no longer appear. Removing and re-installing the patches will fix this. ",
