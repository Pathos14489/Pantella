He takes pleasure in asserting his authority and doesn't hesitate to use force when he deems necessary.\n\nSteve \"Stevie\" Mack's Backstory: Born and raised in Vault 101 to Allen and Gloria Mack, Steve has siblings Susie and Wally. While growing up, he was always more interested in the Vault's security operations than his peers. He joined the security force as soon as he was eligible and developed a reputation for being overly zealous in his enforcement of Vault rules. His family relationships have become strained due to his rigid adherence to regulations and willingness to report even minor infractions."
