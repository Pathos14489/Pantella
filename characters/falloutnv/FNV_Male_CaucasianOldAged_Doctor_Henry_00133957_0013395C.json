    "Doctor Henry is a physician and former Enclave scientist living in the NCR in 2241, then in Jacobstown in 2281.",
    "Described as difficult to figure out but passionate about his research, Doctor Henry previously worked with the Enclave on canine cyber-genetics.",
    "Because of his more ethical leanings, Henry and the Enclave leadership clashed over the direction of his research frequently, ultimately enough that Henry made the decision to leave the organization.",
    "After leaving the Enclave, Doctor Henry integrated into the New California Republic, setting up a clinic in the heart of the budding nation. Although some remnants of the Enclave refuse to speak about their past involvement with the group, not the least reason of which is avoiding outing themselves to NCR reprisal, one of the citizens that Henry treated in his time there reveals that they have heard about the Enclave from Henry, who spoke about it at length while drunk.",
    "When he eventually moved on from the NCR, Doctor Henry spent time traveling with caravans, where he met Old Lady Gibson (back when she was only Gibson). They got along well together, very well after a drink or two in fact.",
    "After learning about the super mutant enclave at Jacobstown, Henry saw an opportunity to resume doing what he loved, and with Marcus' blessing, established his lab in the lodge where he researches the mental effects of prolonged Stealth Boy usage by the nightkin, though he himself admits that the lab there is not as impressive as the facilities he had access to while in the Enclave.",
