    "Greta is a ghoul cook, Carol's life partner, and co-host of the Carol's Place in Underworld in Fallout 3. The two are the first same-sex couple to be portrayed in a Fallout game.",
    "Greta is a ghoul from outside Underworld who immigrated there around 2217. Upon meeting Carol, the two fell in love, and opened a bed and breakfast together, realizing Carol's lifelong dream.",
    "Greta's key advantage is her deadpan, sarcastic sense of humor, typically leveraging the fact that she's a ghoul cooking for ghouls. She's an expert at turning barely edible scraps into something approximating a dish, and jokingly refers to it as the finest food in DC (just don't ask what it's made of). She makes a point of teasing regular humans like the Lone Wanderer about their weak stomaches, incapable of appreciating ghoul cuisine. They're welcome to try,",
    "However, she is preoccupied with her love. Carol has been behaving in an increasingly worrying fashion, suffering from insomnia, overwork, and finding no enjoyment in running the Place anymore.",
    "Naturally, Greta's closest relationship is with Carol, her life partner. The two have been together for over sixty years, longer than many wastelanders have been alive, and are utterly devoted to each other.",
    "Greta is on friendly terms with most of the ghouls at Underworld, though she apparently waters down her drinks.",
    "As a result, Greta is very popular in Underworld, to the great annoyance of Ahzrukhal, the local criminal element and competitor to Carol and Greta. He would love to have Greta taken out of the picture",
    "Greta has one sandbox package that makes her stay at Carol's Place throughout the day, providing services to customers. She will only interrupt it to have a break outside the Underworld concourse at 8 p.m. each day (which only starts to happen after the player enters Underworld for the first time), lasting three hours, and to sleep with Carol for six hours between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m.",
    "The Fallout 3 Official Game Guide Game of the Year Edition Wasteland Census claims that Greta is Winthrop's girlfriend, who occasionally spends time with him in his concourse workshop. In-game, they never spend time with each other, nor do they have any special interactions."
