    "Ken Ewers is a resident of Arefu in 2277.",
    "Ken is terrified of the current attacks that have been plaguing Arefu. He masks this by being incredibly short and gruff with strangers and will only impart the smallest tidbits of useless information to them. He is fiercely overprotective of his wife Brailee and will interpose himself if anyone even tries speaking with her. He is paranoid and lacks physical fighting skills.",
    "His wife's mentality was brought about by the combination of all the trouble around Arefu, living off a poor diet of prepackaged \"food\" and being confined to their home with Ken for long periods of time. In her delusion, she has compensated by creating a utopian world inside her mind.",
    "After the Family began targeting Arefu for sustenance, and their culmination of the murder of the brahmin, Evan King put the settlement into lockdown, leaving himself as the sole guard. Ken does not believe that this will make them any safer and believes that they need to take action. He, however, follows what King tells him to do as the settlement's leader.",
    "Ken stays in his home all day. Upon completion of Blood Ties, he will come outside and roam around along with the other residents."
