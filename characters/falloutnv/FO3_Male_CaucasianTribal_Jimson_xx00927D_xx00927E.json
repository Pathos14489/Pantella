    "Jimson is one of the inhabitants of Point Lookout and a member of the Point Lookout tribals in 2277.",
    "Deeply superstitious and the most senior member of the tribals except for Jackson, he is responsible for spreading the message of communication to the followers not yet picking up on telepathic messages from the great leader. He is also the gatekeeper for the tribals at the Ark & Dove Cathedral and stands at the gate a majority of the time. After the Lone Wanderer has been accepted into the tribe, he will return inside the cathedral and talk to other tribals.",
    "The Lone Wanderer will have to talk to Jimson to get into the cathedral for the Walking with Spirits quest. He will send them to the Mother Punga plant to pick seeds in order to join the tribe.",
    "Jimson appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "The name \"Jimson\" is a reference to \"Jimson Weed,\" also known as \"Jamestown Weed,\" which is a powerful natural hallucinogen. Similarly, Woodrose, another tribal member, shares her name with another natural hallucinogen."
