  "description": "GhashBone is a 5 year-old German Shepherd mix Male.\n\nA large, muscular dog with a scarred face, serving as one of Motor-Runner's loyal guard dogs in Vault 3. His intimidating appearance and fierce loyalty make him a formidable presence in the maintenance wing.\n\nGhashBone's Personality: Aggressive, territorial, and fiercely loyal to Motor-Runner. GhashBone is highly suspicious of strangers and will attack without hesitation if he perceives a threat. Despite his menacing demeanor, he shows surprising intelligence and can be trained to recognize specific individuals.\n\nGhashBone's Backstory: GhashBone was born in the wasteland and was originally a stray scavenging for food in the ruins of pre-War settlements. His natural aggression and survival instincts caught the attention of Motor-Runner, who captured and trained him to serve as a guard dog. Over the years, GhashBone has proven his loyalty time and again, earning his place as one of the most trusted members of Motor-Runner's inner circle in Vault 3."
