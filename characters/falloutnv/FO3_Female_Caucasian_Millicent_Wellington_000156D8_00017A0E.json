    "Millicent Wellington is a resident of Tenpenny Tower in 2277, who can often be found arguing with her husband, Edgar Wellington II, or demanding his attention.",
    "Millicent is one of the few souls who live in security in the Capital Wasteland, behind the stone walls of Tenpenny Tower. She lives in the tower with her husband, Edgar and, like her husband, comes off as rude and snobbish. She is the Tower's resident gossip and is infamous among its inhabitants for her busybody nature, to the point where her husband can be heard calling her a \"social hermit\" for her inability to form friendships with the female residents of the tower. She rejects being asked to socialize with them, chalking up her meager social circle as being a product of their jealousy towards her, rather than acknowledge the role her gossiping has had in influencing her relationships with her fellow residents.",
    "Millicent makes no attempt to hide her bigoted nature and may go as far as to insult the player character by questioning their upbringing, suggesting they were raised by beasts, a pack of ghouls or brought up in a Vault.",
    "Tenpenny Tower: She is one of several residents the Lone Wanderer must try to convince to change her mind if they are attempting to help move Roy Phillips' ghouls into Tenpenny Tower.",
    "If the Lone Wanderer takes the love letter off Susan Lancaster's desk and takes it to Millicent, she will threaten to kill both her husband and his mistress, and will immediately run off to find her husband. She will proceed to kill him with her 10mm pistol, and go after Susan herself (the guards seem not to mind). After both murders are committed, she will abandon Tenpenny Tower and head for the Warrington trainyard, where she will head into the tunnels to meet her death at the hands of the ghouls. If the Lone Wanderer follows her and successfully defends her from the ghouls, Millicent will stay in the first maintenance room found along the tunnels.",
    "* Only if one shows her the love letter."
