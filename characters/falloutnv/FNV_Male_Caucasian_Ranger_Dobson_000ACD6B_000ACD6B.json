    "Dobson is a member of the New California Republic's Rangers camping out around Hidden Valley in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "A Redding native,",
    "By 2281, he was deployed to the Mojave and stationed at Camp McCarran, but sometime around October of that year, he went off on his own to assess and scout out the NCR Correctional Facility for reconnaissance on the Powder Gangers occupying the facility. He made his camp in one of the pre-War military bunkers scattered around Hidden Valley, intending to use it as a safehouse.",
    "Ever since coming to Hidden Valley, however, his one-man operation has been fairly problematic, mostly to do with bringing his radio to broadcast properly. Despite the difficulties, the area's \"natural phenomena\" sandstorms and the bunker's remote location still make it worth the hassle, as it keeps him relatively safe from any predators or troublemakers topside.",
    "Unbeknownst to Dobson, his off-the-books scouting operation put him in the crosshairs of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel, due to his bunker safehouse being only a short walk away from the one they have occupied in secret since their loss to the NCR at HELIOS One during Operation: Sunburst years prior. While the Brotherhood is still strong enough to take out a single Ranger, they have held off on attacking Dobson due to the paranoid belief that his absence will be noticed and draw more attention from their long-time enemy to Hidden Valley, unaware of the maverick nature of Dobson's arrival in the first place.",
    "Dobson is a confident individual and takes pride in his work protecting the innocent of the Mojave Wasteland, but like any good Ranger; he is not headstrong and knows his limits."
