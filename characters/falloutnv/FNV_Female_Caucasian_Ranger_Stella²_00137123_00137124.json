    "Ranger Stella is a member of the New California Republic Rangers held prisoner by Caesar's Legion at the Fort in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "Sometime around October 2281, Stella was abducted by the Legion from Ranger Station Charlie; being a woman, she was enslaved. Her Ranger training, however, put her above the typical women the Legion enslaved, and so Stella was forced to regularly engage in fights with legionaries in their arena; at least one of these fights was against an elite centurion that ended in Stella's victory and the man's death."
