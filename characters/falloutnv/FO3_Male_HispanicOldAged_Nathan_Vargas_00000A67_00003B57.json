    "Nathaniel \"Nathan\" Vargas is a citizen of Megaton in 2277. He appears in Fallout 3.",
    "Nathan ran a caravan route for over 30 years with his wife, Manya. It was during this period that he became obsessed with the Enclave. He has become a bit of a fanatic, believing that the Enclave will bring salvation to the wasteland, and is trying to convince everyone else in Megaton of this fact. Most of the residents write Nathan off as the local busybody, but all are quick to note that after 30 years on the back of a wagon, he is still a skilled marksman.",
    "He believes all of the Enclave propaganda he hears over Enclave Radio to the letter, and openly praises them as saviors of the wastes. Nathan promises the Lone Wanderer that, \"Things will be different when the Enclave gets here.\" Nathan has an open tab at Moriarty's Saloon, which currently stands at 8 caps.",
    "Manya Vargas is his wife.",
    "He will ask the Lone Wanderer about their opinion of the Enclave. He will praise them if they say the Enclave is good; saying that the U.S. is a great country and that \"even if you were born in some underground Vault, you were born under the United States, which makes you an American.\"",
    "If Nathan dies at any point, the player character will no longer be able to open dialogue with Manya. Instead, she will simply acknowledge that Nathan is dead, and will sometimes drift off thinking of him before he died. Other characters in Megaton will also mention Nathan's death and Manya's depression in their random conversations."
