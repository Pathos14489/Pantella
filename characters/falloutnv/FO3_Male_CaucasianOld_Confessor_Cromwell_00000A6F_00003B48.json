    "Confessor Cromwell is a member of the Church of the Children of Atom residing in Megaton in the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3, where he leads the Children in the worship of the undetonated atomic bomb that gave Megaton its name.",
    "Cromwell traveled across the Capital Wasteland in his youth before settling in Megaton, where he first encountered the Children of Atom. In his personal quarters in Megaton, he keeps a personal journal on a terminal.",
    "Considered the \"father of the undying Glow,\"",
    "At some point between the 2250s and the 2270s, Cromwell sent an expedition to spread the word of Atom to the rest of the wasteland along the East Coast, led by Martin and including Tektus. The expedition's path eventually brought them to the Island off the coast of the state of Maine, far north from the Capital Wastes. After becoming a High Confessor himself following Martin's disappearance, Tektus still maintains respect for Cromwell, referring to him as \"Atom's great prophet.\"",
    "When the Last Son of Atom arrived at Isolde's village in the Commonwealth in 2286, he claimed to have studied the faith under Cromwell at Megaton.",
    "Cromwell can be seen standing in the center of town, next to the bomb, praying to it in ankle-deep irradiated water. He even beseeches Atom to \"shape his fragile form.\" He is heard preaching to his audience about the teachings of the Children of Atom, mainly on the subject of \"birthing a thousand stars,\" relating to his (and the Children of Atom's) belief that inside every atom is an entire universe.",
    "Confessor Cromwell appears in Fallout 3, and as a legendary dweller in Fallout Shelter. He is also mentioned in the Fallout 4 add-on Far Harbor."
