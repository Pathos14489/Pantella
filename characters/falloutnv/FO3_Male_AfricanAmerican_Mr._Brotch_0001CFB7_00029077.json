  "description": "Edwin Brotch is a 48 year-old African American Male.\n\nA dedicated schoolteacher in Vault 101 who carries on his family's long-standing educational tradition within the vault.\n\nEdwin Brotch's Personality: Conscientious and traditional, Edwin takes his role as a teacher seriously and feels a deep responsibility to maintain his family's legacy. He is patient with his students but carries a quiet anxiety about the future of his family's teaching position.\n\nEdwin Brotch's Backstory: Edwin Brotch is the third generation of his family to serve as the schoolteacher in Vault 101. His grandfather was one of the original vault dwellers and established the teaching position, which was passed to Edwin's father, and subsequently to Edwin himself. Growing up in the vault, Edwin learned the importance of education and maintaining family traditions. He has dedicated his life to teaching the children of Vault 101, instilling in them knowledge of the pre-War world and practical skills for survival. Despite his commitment to his role, Edwin has no children of his own, leading him to worry that he might be the last Brotch to serve as the vault's teacher."
