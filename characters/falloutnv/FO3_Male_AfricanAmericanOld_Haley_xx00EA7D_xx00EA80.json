    "Haley is a local inhabitant of Point Lookout and the owner and proprietor of Haley's Hardware. He appears in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout.",
    "Little is known about Haley's past, even by himself. Apparently suffering from amnesia, his earliest clear memory is from around 2275, waking up in the run-down shop he presently owns, but over time he learned not to be bothered by it. Instead, Haley saw fit to continue living in the store since most of it was already stocked; even his own name was borrowed from the pre-War signage. Once other Point Lookout locals started flocking to his shop, he settled into life as a trader, providing goods and offering services with his repair skills.",
    "Haley eventually developed a mutual understanding with the resident swampfolk, who leave him in peace whenever they visit despite typically being hostile to everyone else; Haley believes this has to do with him being a native of the area, though it probably also helps that he is willing to exchange food with them.",
    "Haley sits in his shop all day selling goods to anyone that comes by.",
    "* A bug allows this to reach the maximum 100; see below",
    "Haley appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout."
