    "The wasteland adventurer is a cut character in Fallout: New Vegas.",
    "The unnamed adventurer would have been knowledgeable about important locations around the deserts of the Mojave Wasteland. He would have made a living by hunting around the nearby area and selling the spoils to traders.",
    "He would have initially been found standing in front of the road sign at the intersection near Jean Sky Diving, southeast of Goodsprings. After exhausting all dialogue options, he would then have proceeded to patrol the nearby area around the pre-War recreation area until 8PM when he would have returned to the small trailer south of the Goodsprings source and slept until 7AM.",
    "The wasteland adventurer was originally intended to appear in Fallout: New Vegas but was cut from the final game."
