    "James Garret is the co-owner of the Atomic Wrangler Casino, along with his twin sister Francine Garret. He lives in Freeside in 2281.",
    "James is looking for prostitutes for his escort service. Speaking to him can begin the quest Wang Dang Atomic Tango which, despite the dubious connotations, does not give any negative Karma.",
    "Though he denies it, James is also an alleged closet robot fetishist. With a Speech of 40, talking to James about Fisto after the quest, Wang Dang Atomic Tango will result in some humorous dialogue.",
    "James is at the counter of the Atomic Wrangler from 1 PM to 8 AM the next morning, heading upstairs for a short nap in the late morning.",
    "James will refuse to serve the player if they have a negative reputation in Freeside, instead offering to improve their reputation for a price.",
    "The player can pay James to improve their reputation in Freeside, either adding positive reputation or removing negative reputation. Both options can be used three times, each rewarding a different amount of rep for a varying amount of caps."
