    "Lulu is a raider and chef in the Pitt in 2277.",
    "Lulu roams Uptown's walkways, praising Lord Ashur and feeding noodles to Uptown's raider population. An insane but fiercely loyal follower of Ashur, Lulu refers to everyone as \"pets\" belonging to Ashur, because Ashur chose all of them, including herself, to be in his company. She makes a distinction between \"good\" and \"bad\" pets: those who contribute and earn their keep are \"good,\" while the \"bad\" ones are drowned in the Monongahela River.",
    "Lulu appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "Lulu's noodles and position in Uptown parallel the location of Lulu's Noodles in Pittsburgh's Oakland region."
