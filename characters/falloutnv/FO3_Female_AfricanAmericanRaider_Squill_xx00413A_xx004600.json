    "Squill is a member of the Pitt raiders in 2277.",
    "Unlike many of the other Pitt raiders, Squill is a good-natured and enthusiastic soldier.",
    "Squill happily mentions that she often fires into the arena from the spectator area if the fight is not exciting enough. She also mentions that when this was done to her when she was a gladiator slave, she shot back, and hopes the Lone Wanderer would do the same as she did if she had shot down at them during their own fights.",
    "Squill appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "Squill's name comes from the local shortening of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh."
