  "description": "Rancorous Ruth is a 68 year-old Caucasian Female.\n\nAn elderly woman and member of Maud's Muggers who preys on unsuspecting travelers near Cerulean Robotics in Freeside. Despite her advanced age, she remains surprisingly agile and dangerous in an ambush.\n\nRancorous Ruth's Personality: Aggressive and desperate, Ruth is a survivor who will do whatever it takes to get by in the harsh Mojave Wasteland. She is fiercely loyal to her small gang and takes pride in her ability to catch people off guard. Beneath her tough exterior, she harbors a deep resentment for the world that has left her with few options in her twilight years.\n\nRancorous Ruth's Backstory: Ruth once had a normal life before the Great War, but like many others, she lost everything in the apocalypse. Over the decades, she struggled to survive, eventually ending up in Freeside where she formed a bond with Malefic Maud and Irate Ida. Together, they formed Maud's Muggers, finding strength in numbers and a shared purpose in their twilight years. Ruth has become the tallest and most physically capable of the three, often taking point in their ambushes."
