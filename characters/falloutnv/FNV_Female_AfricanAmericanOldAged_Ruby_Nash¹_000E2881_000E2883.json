    "Ruby Nash is a Primm citizen in 2281.",
    "She and her husband Johnson Nash have lived in Primm since around 2272 and together they run the town's Mojave Express outpost. At first, one can find her at the Vikki and Vance Casino, where she and the rest of Primm's inhabitants fled after the Powder Gangers killed the sheriff and took the deputy hostage in the Bison Steve Hotel.",
    "After restoring order by finishing the quest My Kind of Town, she and her husband return to their home inside the Mojave Express building. Afterward, she can be found walking outside or inside the Vikki and Vance smoking a cigarette by the slot machines."
