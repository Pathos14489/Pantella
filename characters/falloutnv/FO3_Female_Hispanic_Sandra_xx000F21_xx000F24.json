    "Dr. Sandra Kundanika is a scientist working and living in the Pitt in 2277.",
    "Sandra intentionally joined the city because she recognized it as a powerful and influential force. Ishmael Ashur realized she was a smart woman as she had a good education, and offered to support her research. She conducted research into the Trogs and named their disease the Troglodyte Degeneration Contagion (TDC).",
    "Sandra eventually became Ashur's wife, the two sharing a genuine love for each other, and she agrees with his plan of building an army and uniting the wasteland. Although Sandra shares a lot of the ruthlessness with the other raiders, she prefers non-violence whenever possible.",
    "Sandra and Ashur became the parents of baby Marie.",
    "She spends her day in the back of the Haven's top floor researching a cure.",
    "Dr. Sandra Kundanika appears only in the Fallout 3 add-on The Pitt.",
    "PC Should the player character side with Wernher and choose to spare her, assuming that she is not killed by trogs, the player character can return after completing Free Labor and speak with her as long enough time has passed for her to turn friendly. She will address the player character as though they had kidnapped Marie, but gave her back and sided with the slavers. This will allow the player character to bring teddy bears to her for Marie even though the player character did not side with Ashur."
