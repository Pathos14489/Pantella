    "Little Buster is an ex-merc turned bounty hunter living at Camp McCarran in 2281.",
    "Hardly working but not working hard, Buster has a long resume filled with various jobs he always got bored of before long. Before taking up bounty hunting, Buster was a caravan guard but quit because he was expected to wake up early in the morning, a routine incompatible with his required sleep of ten to twelve hours per day.",
    "Little Buster talks big about both himself and his accomplishments, claiming to be \"one of the greatest\" bounty hunters in the wasteland, having killed dangerous marks such as Night Terror and Jackson, and boasts an incredible single month of experience (longer than most jobs he has held).",
    "Like many of his jobs before, Buster's losing interest, getting tired of the amount of work bounty hunting calls for, and not invested enough to risk his life on a daily basis,",
    "While Little Buster is training on the mannequin at Camp McCarran, standing behind the mannequin will result in Little Buster hitting the player character in the head, which may eventually cripple their head.",
    "Little Buster's character design was concepted by Joshua Sawyer, while his dialogue was written by John Gonzalez.",
    "PC Playstation 3 Xbox 360 After completing Three-Card Bounty, Little Buster's body may not show up anywhere near Freeside. This can be circumvented on PC by using the console command prid 172944 enable."
