    "Carlos is a homeless water beggar sitting across the bridge from Rivet City in Fallout 3. He is one of three beggars, the others being Micky outside Megaton and Willy outside Tenpenny Tower.",
    "Carlos is a survivor of a super mutant abduction, who narrowly escaped winding up on a mutant bonfire. He made his way to Rivet City, but has been unable to enter the vessel and resigned himself to begging at the entry station. He was drinking the irradiated water from the Anacostia, but lately his body revolted against the radiation and he just throws dirty water right back up.",
    "As a result, he is increasingly dehydrated, with all the effects to cognition and thinking that entails. His only hope is that a kindly stranger or water caravan passes by to Rivet City and takes pity on him."
