    "Doctor Mobius is a think tank operating in the Big MT in 2281. He is the leader of the robo-scorpion army and nemesis of Dr. Klein and the team to which he belonged.",
    "Doctor Mobius was one of the Big MT \"Think Tank\" executives before the Great War. Sometime after the War, he became a think tank in order to continue his work at Big MT. Like the others, he forgot a part of his personality and his real name, due to the recursion loop in their new perception programming.",
    "After the escape of the cazadores and night stalkers, Mobius became disillusioned with the methods of the other think tanks. He grew tired of the endless and horrible experimentation and was deeply afraid of the damage the amoral and psychosis-ridden think tanks would wreak upon the fragile, post-apocalyptic world in the name of science.",
    "After a severe dispute with Klein, Mobius removed all the chips of all personalities of The Sink; his room and personal laboratory,",
    "Afterward, Mobius moved to the X-42 robo-warfare facility (which he renamed the \"Forbidden Zone\") and began to \"recreate\" the robo-scorpion, inspired by radscorpions that had wandered into Big MT. These new versions included all features of the pre-War model, such as an energy bolt blaster in the tail, highly sensitive robotic eyes, and communication systems connected directly to his stronghold.\nWith the remaining think tanks trapped in the central dome by their exaggerated fear of Mobius, the Big MT fell mostly silent.",
    "Although not originally aggressive in his intentions, Mobius' own behavior seems to have degraded over the years, likely in part due to an increasingly serious addiction to Mentats and Psycho.",
    "The arrival of the Courier, and the subsequent survival of their lobotomy proved to be the last straw. Eventually, the Courier defeats the X-42 giant robo-scorpion, enters the Forbidden Zone and confronts Mobius.",
    "Mobius appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues."
