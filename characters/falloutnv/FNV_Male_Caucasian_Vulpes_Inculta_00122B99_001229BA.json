    "Vulpes Inculta is the leader of the frumentarii in Caesar's Legion and one of the trusted men of Caesar, traveling in the Mojave Wasteland with a group of legionaries who attacked Nipton in 2281.",
    "An individual from a tribe south of \"the Utah\", Vulpes was brought into Caesar's Legion as a child.",
    "According to Ulysses, Vulpes Inculta was responsible for the destruction of the Twisted Hairs at Dry Wells",
    "Vulpes is a devout believer of the dogma of Caesar perpetuating all his acts for the Legion, and firmly holds loyalty up as one the Legion's core tenets along with martial excellence and justice.",
    "Vulpes Inculta appears in Fallout: New Vegas and is mentioned in its add-on Lonesome Road.",
    "In Latin, vulpes translates as \"fox,\" while inculta can translate as \"uncultivated\" or \"rough.\" According to Joshua Sawyer, \"desert fox\" was one intended meaning behind Vulpes' name, but he acknowledged that he was not sure of the process behind naming the character, and it may have changed at some point.",
