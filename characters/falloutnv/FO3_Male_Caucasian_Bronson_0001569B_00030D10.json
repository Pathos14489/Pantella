    "Bronson is a slave being held in Paradise Falls in 2277.",
    "Bronson is both a slave and a drunk, drinking as a coping mechanism as he spends his days making a mockery of himself for the slavers' amusement.",
    "Bleak has been tasking Bronson with finding equipment, including slave collar detonators, to help them escape; this is to no avail as he consistently returns with the wrong items, hindered by his constant drunkenness as he fails to remember and recognize what Bleak is asking for.",
    "Bronson is locked up in the Paradise Falls slave pen, spending his entire life there until he is killed or has escaped.",
    "When first interacting with him, he offers to show the Lone Wanderer something funny, or asks if they wish to hear a song or see a dance, but only in exchange for booze. However, the player cannot give any alcohol and therefore cannot exchange booze for anything."
