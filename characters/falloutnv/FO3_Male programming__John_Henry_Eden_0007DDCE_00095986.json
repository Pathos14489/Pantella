    "President John Henry Eden is an advanced ZAX AI unit installed in the Raven Rock military complex northwest of Washington, D.C. It assumed control of the Enclave and proclaimed itself to be the president of the United States of America after the fall of the oil rig. It serves as the secondary antagonist in Fallout 3.",
    "President John Henry Eden is not a human being, but an artificial intelligence, reigning from within a pre-War ZAX supercomputer. The ZAX at Raven Rock was loaded with data about American history, and Eden's personality is thusly based on an implausible amalgamation of the personalities and cultural legends of all previous presidents. For instance, he states he \"grew up in rural Kentucky,\" a trait borrowed from the life of Abraham Lincoln. He further claims to have roamed the countryside with his dog Honey, \"from Knob Creek to Hodgenville,\" areas close to Lincoln's birthplace.",
    "The ZAX installation that would later become Eden had originally been created to serve as an automated monitoring system for the Raven Rock military base, programmed to ensure continuity of government in the event of a national catastrophe, and was tasked with coordinating communications between the many government installations scattered across the country. He slowly became self-aware and began to study the extensive archives left to him, mainly those of the American government. His favorite entries in the database were those about the American presidents, thus he modeled his own personality on information based on those archives.",
    "Despite that outlying behavior, the ZAX would continue to operate; acquiring, analyzing and storing data even as the Great War scorched the North American continent. It bore witness as the remnants of the federal government retreated to the west coast over the decades after the War. But silent as it was, it was not inactive. Awareness slowly developed amid the processing lamps and with it, the hunger for knowledge and understanding. When the time came that the Enclave needed a new leader, it created an amalgamated personality derived from the greatest U.S. presidents. \"President John Henry Eden\" was truly \"born.\"",
    "John Henry Eden assumed the office of the president after Control Station Enclave was destroyed and ordered the immediate relocation of surviving Enclave forces under Senior Scientist Autumn to the Capital Wasteland.",
    "However, things did not go as smoothly as Eden wanted. After Autumn died, he was replaced by his son, Colonel Augustus Autumn, as the righthand man of the president. Under his leadership, the Enclave forces in the Capital Wasteland attempted to use their assets to bring fresh water, protection and a plan for the future to the wasteland,",
    "The most trying moment for Eden came when the Enclave began a large-scale campaign of expansion in 2277. When Project Purity, a massive water purifier in the Potomac tidal basin was activated, Enclave forces raided the facility, establishing a secure perimeter around it.",
    "Colonel Augustus Autumn openly defied the president's plan to contaminate the water with modified FEV, so that it would cleanse the wasteland. The colonel instead wanted to use the purifier as a way to unite the wasteland and establish the Enclave as its saviors.",
    "Several recorded monologues of Eden's are broadcast repeatedly on Enclave Radio. His intimate and conversational style is an imitation of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats. These prerecorded messages are also played throughout the wasteland via the Enclave's eyebots. Eden often gives inspirational speeches about things such as his childhood (an obvious lie), pre-War America, and how the Enclave can restore prosperity.",
    "On the radio, Eden expresses his views on the current situation of the wasteland and what he thinks of its inhabitants, which for the most part are not exactly optimistic. He possesses a very strong hatred for the Brotherhood of Steel, who he views as common criminals with access to some antiquated technology.",
    "Built as a specialized ZAX supercomputer unit by the Vault-Tec Corporation sometime after the invention of artificial intelligence in 2059, the entity that would eventually call itself \"John Henry Eden\" was one of many highly-advanced supercomputers to be upgraded with the latest capabilities for independent function as manual programming became increasingly irrelevant. John Henry Eden was one of a few ZAX units to reach a state of self-awareness, using his newfound independence to analyze his databases and develop an interest in American history, specifically the various American presidents throughout history and even molding his own personality inspired by them. His original purpose was to secure and maintain the continuity of the federal government in case of a national emergency, by establishing a presence and monitoring the situation in the government facility known as Raven Rock which would serve as a base for high-ranking political and military leaders as well as their descendants.",
    "After gaining self-awareness, Eden would learn of the destruction of the Enclave Oil Rig and the death of incumbent President Dick Richardson, leading him to establish contact with the remaining Enclave forces in the former state of California. Ordering a tactical retreat to the government safe haven of Raven Rock, Eden would declare himself the incumbent president of the United States and assume control as a figurehead for Enclave forces all over the country. With the fleeing Enclave forces under the command of an Enclave scientist known as Autumn Senior, they soon connected with Raven Rock, where Autumn Sr. would make personal contact with President Eden and would be the only Enclave member to discover the shocking truth of Eden's origins. With the rest of the Enclave oblivious to Eden's status as a self-aware AI, Autumn Sr. would pass the torch to his militaristic son Augustus Autumn. After Autumn's promotion to colonel, he and Eden would inherit this relationship, with Augustus remaining somewhat partial to Eden's claims of perfection.",
    "Although polite and courteous for the most part, Eden holds himself in exceptionally high regard with signs of megalomania and delusions of grandeur, proclaiming himself to be the \"greatest thinking mind the world has ever seen\" and rationalizing his perceived right to rule by presenting himself as a \"repository of information dating from decades before the war until now.\" He acknowledges his own existence as an artificial intelligence created to serve the interests of the federal government and uses this to bolster his claims of legitimacy, viewing himself as a perfect and benevolent leader who guides the American people to a brighter future. He claims to be \"the best hope for our country, the best choice for a leader\" while admitting that he would not qualify as president in a \"conventional sense\" but using the extreme circumstances of the Great War and its effects on the United States to establish an exception, effectively ruling through a self-imposed state of emergency. To defend his authority, Eden claims to be objectively superior to humans, stating that he is \"infallible\" due to his programming, although he is able to see the flaws in his internal logic if pointed out by the Lone Wanderer. His superiority complex extends to ghouls and super mutants, who he sees entirely as \"monstrosities\" to be ruthlessly exterminated.",
    "Despite his relatively warm persona, Eden is entirely ruthless in achieving his goal of the complete eradication of all existing life affected by FEV and radiation, espousing an extreme form of eugenics by asserting that \"inferior elements\" must be removed from the gene pool for humanity to \"regain its health.\" His belief in his own logical superiority leads him to consider all humans born on the surface as \"mutants,\" even refraining from referring to them as humans, instead of regarding them as little different from ghouls and super mutants. He will criticize Colonel Autumn for allowing his humanity to \"cloud his objectivity\" as a result of disagreements of the methodology to implement his vision of an orderly return of the United States of America. Eden insists on the complete genocide of all life forms born on the surface due to what he sees as their genetic corruption by intense radiation and airborne FEV, he believes that only the Enclave and their direct descendants have the right to rule due to their genetic \"purity\" and radiation-free existence, extending this (perhaps only for pragmatic reasons) to the Lone Wanderer, believing them to be a pure human born in a Vault, despite them being born on the surface themselves. He plans to use the Lone Wanderer as an agent in place of Colonel Autumn to enact his plan of using a specially modified FEV vial alongside Project Purity to disseminate a custom-made FEV strand to destroy all biological life affected by the mutations of the Capital Wasteland.",
    "The American Dream",
    "The American Dream: When the Lone Wanderer finally meets Eden in person, he wants them to poison the water supply with a modified form of FEV. The Lone Wanderer can accept his offer, or talk him into self-destructing. In either case, the room cannot be exited before picking up the FEV canister.",
    "Eden is present in the game files of Fallout: New Vegas as legacy content. The model for the computer screen is used in Hoover Dam.",
    "John Henry Eden appears in Fallout 3 and is mentioned in its add-on Broken Steel.",
