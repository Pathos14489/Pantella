    "Vance is the leader of a group of \"vampires\" called the Family in 2277.",
    "When Vance was younger, he decided that life in Rivet City was not for him and began to wander the wasteland. Soon, the ability to find others of his \"kind\" manifested itself. Over time, he gathered these outcasts and founded their home in Meresti. Using his traits as a basis and wanting to establish some sort of society, he molded the residents into \"vampires\" and taught them his bloodsucking ways.",
    "He is a fair leader and has never demanded anyone do anything they did not wish to do, nor does he wish to put anyone in harm's way. He sees himself as a leader, but more in the way of a guide or a priest than a king. He addresses the residents of Meresti often so they will never \"stray from their true nature,\" that of the vampire. Vance is not violent and only attacks or orders attacks when survival demands it.",
    "Vance has a very high amount of Hit Points, being significantly tougher than a standard human non-player character. His durability is slightly less than that of a joinable non-player character companion and (with his armor), slightly more than that of a super mutant brute. His weapon of choice is the Shishkebab. Combat with him can be difficult if the player character chooses to deal with the Family violently."
