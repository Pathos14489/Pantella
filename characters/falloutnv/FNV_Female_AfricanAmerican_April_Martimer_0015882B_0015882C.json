    "April Martimer is a scientist living at the Old Mormon Fort in Freeside in 2281.",
    "April Martimer is a scientist and a member of the Followers of the Apocalypse. She will express her interest in examining ED-E, a prototype duraframe eyebot carrying Poseidon Energy research data, so that she can extract the data and put it to good use in the future. She resents the Brotherhood of Steel, who also have an interest in the eyebot since they will be using the data to their own benefit.",
    "She will contact the Courier through ED-E once its audio logs are unlocked. Once ED-E is upgraded either by her or the Brotherhood, she will vanish from the fort."
