Castillo is a no-nonsense individual who takes pride in his role and the Ranger's reputation as elite fighters.\n\nComm Officer Castillo's Personality: Straightforward and pragmatic, Castillo prefers to focus on the present rather than dwelling on history. He is disciplined, efficient, and takes his duties seriously. While he respects the Rangers' legacy, he believes their strength lies in their current capabilities and training rather than past glories.\n\nComm Officer Castillo's Backstory: Born and raised in the NCR territories, Castillo showed an aptitude for technology and communication from a young age. He enlisted in the NCR military at 18 and quickly rose through the ranks due to his technical skills and disciplined approach. After five years of service, he was selected for Ranger training, where he excelled in communications and tactical operations. For the past ten years, he has served as a Communications Officer, coordinating between Ranger Stations and maintaining the vital communication lines across the Mojave."
