She appears to have been burned to death, possibly during the Legion's attack on the town.\n\nBeru's Personality: Not applicable (deceased)\n\nBeru's Backstory: Beru was a resident of Nipton who, along with her companion Owen, was killed during Caesar's Legion's attack on the town in 2281. Their bodies were left among the ruins as a warning to others. They were likely simple townspeople trying to survive in the harsh Mojave Wasteland."
