    "Sydney is a mercenary who specializes in relic hunting in the year 2277, and a temporary companion in Fallout 3.",
    "Sydney is a self-taught survivor, who braved the wasteland all on her own since the age of fourteen; her mother was raped and killed by raiders,",
    "The skills he taught her, especially gunsmithing and reloading, served her well over the years. She learned to always be ready for a fight, to the point of sleeping with a gun under her pillow all the time,",
    "Sydney is loyal and professional. She never reneges on a deal and focuses on the task at hand, and typically works alone. When she has to work with someone, she prefers not to discuss her past and other personal topics. She dislikes men approaching her (a difficult thing to avoid, on account of her looks),",
    "Stealing Independence",
    "The player can obtain her unique SMG by delivering her a note from her father. See below for details.",
    "* If she finishes the quest alive and makes it to Underworld."
