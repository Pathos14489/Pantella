    "The Pitt slave lead conspirator is the head of a group of slaves working toward a slave uprising in the Pitt in 2277.",
    "The leader meets with a few other slaves in the Pitt Downtown, near a wrecked bus where Adan works. He and his cohorts will discuss the coming slave uprising; the leader himself will ask if one of the members completed their mission successfully and if others \"got those packages.\" Their meeting will break up should the Lone Wanderer approach the group, as a lookout will whistle to warn the conspirators. After this, the leader will leave the area and wander around the town.",
