  "description": "Alice McBride is a 75 year-old Human Female.\n\nAlice McBride is an elderly farmer living in Novac, known for her honest and hardworking nature. With weathered skin and kind eyes, she has spent most of her life tending to the land outside of Novac. Despite her age, she remains resilient and pragmatic, having witnessed the harsh realities of the wasteland firsthand.\n\nAlice McBride's Personality: Alice is a kind, patient, and pragmatic woman who values honesty and hard work. She's deeply devoted to her husband Dusty and their life together. Though she's seen much of the wasteland's harshness, she maintains a positive outlook on life and is always willing to offer a kind word to travelers passing through Novac.\n\nAlice McBride's Backstory: Alice was born in 2206 in a small settlement near the Colorado River. She met Dusty McBride in her early 20s, and they married in 2256, settling in Novac shortly after. Together, they established their farm on the outskirts of town, growing crops and raising brahmin to sustain themselves and contribute to Novac's food supply. Over their 50+ years of marriage, they've weathered numerous challenges, including raider attacks, droughts, and the constant struggle for survival in the Mojave Wasteland. Alice has become a respected member of the Novac community, known for her wisdom and resilience."
