    "Dukov is a drunken womanizer and retired mercenary in the Capital Wasteland in 2277.",
    "Dukov's life mainly consists of partying and having sex with women, a reflection of his carefree yet sleazy nature. Although he is profane, boisterous, and has an obnoxiously loud and distinctive laugh, Dukov is nevertheless charismatic. He is concerned only with his material possessions, his lavish home (or \"pad\" as he calls it), and women.",
    "He is one of the three surviving mercenaries hired by Allistair Tenpenny for an expedition into Fort Constantine. He is now retired, and lives in his estate (Dukov's Place) along the east bank of the Potomac River in the D.C ruins.",
    "He spends his time drinking lots of alcohol and taking Jet with Cherry and Fantasia. Though one will never see it, he talks often about his \"parties\" with the two girls."
