    "Doctor Klein is a pre-War scientist and the leader of the Think Tank operating in Big MT in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues.",
    "Once an esteemed doctor and serving in the role of the Chief/Head Researcher of Logistical Operations and \"Ideology\" at the Big MT Research and Development Center, sometime after the Great War devastated the U.S.A., the future Dr. Klein and his fellow executives underwent a procedure to extract their brains and place them in robotic think tank shells to continue their work. It was his idea for the Think Tank to survive as brain bots.",
    "At some point before 2281, the Think Tank's amoral and irrational research methods compelled their colleague, the future Doctor Mobius, to use his own knowledge to hack into their robotic forms, erasing their memories of the world beyond Big MT and of pre-War America, in an effort to restrain the Think Tank's destructive potential. However, he was forced to leave them and shelter in the \"Forbidden Zone\" where he sends a looped message of threats of death and destruction to reinforce their warped mindset.",
    "Klein frequently demonstrates an incredible overconfidence in his intelligence, as he shows absolutely no grasp of the purpose or function of the advanced technology he tasks the Courier to retrieve. He also remains very disrespectful of his colleagues and often ignores and criticizes them for suggesting what actions the Think Tank should take. He also proves that he is not above deliberately censoring or outright ignoring evidence that would discredit him.",
    "Along with his original name and human memories, Klein has lost much of his knowledge of human anatomy, and refers to the Courier's fingers and toes as \"penises.\"",
    "Doctor Klein appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Old World Blues."
